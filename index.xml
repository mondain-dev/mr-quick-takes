<p>Tyler is speaking positively of Kamala Harris and negatively of Trump. I'd say he is picking sides. Tyler has also been rather partisan Democrat for his career.</p>
<p>I'd like to ask the economists, what they think of the economics of Kamala Harris:</p>
<p>- She wanted to ban fracking and offshore drilling. Her campaign recently denies this, but relatively recently, Kamala Harris is publicly pledging to ban fracking and offshore drilling.<br />
- On health care, Kamala Harris pledged to eliminating private health insurance and medicare for all.<br />
- Kamala Harris supported the Green New Deal.<br />
- She praised Randi Weingarten, the President of AFT, and the legacy teacher labor unions.<br />
- She had the furthest left voting record in the senate.</p>
<p>Tyler wrote last December, that discussing the 2024 election will make you stupid (https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/12/designed-to-make-you-stupid.html). How about discussing the economics of the proposed economic policy?</p>
</blockquote><p>Fracking damages the environment and many farmers hate it.</p>

<p>Testing the raw milk is a no-brainer. Since pasteurization kills the virus, non-pharmaceutical interventions should be effective without the need for culling. The trick is to keep outbreaks contained to the farm. Testing and "quarantining" farmers makes sense once an outbreak has been identified.

<p>The pathogenesis matters. The intervention should be appropriately aligned to the specific details of the virus/host/disease. YMMV.</p>

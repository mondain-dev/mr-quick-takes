I have literally never had a left wing one. And they seemingly all volunteer their political views without prompting. Is it because by driving around for a living one actually sees what’s going on in the country?"</p>
<p>I've never had an Uber or Lyft driver tell me their political views, left or right.</p>
<p>I suspect that this passenger spouts off about politics, and the drivers respond.</p>
<p>They may indeed skew right-wing, but I wouldn't know.  I've never had one who talked politics.</p>
<p>What they often do talk about, because I often do ask them, is the business model and practices of Uber and Lyft.  Because that's what I ask them about.  Some of them are very clever, doing their own data analysis to work out, not just supply and demand conditions at a given time and place, but how the algorithm works to incentivize the drivers.  And then they figure out their own optimal work pattern.</p>
<p>There's also an interesting range of satisfaction vs dissatisfaction with their companies.  Granted that's probably true of workers in all jobs.</p>

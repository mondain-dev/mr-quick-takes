<p>I am sorry to say that corruption knows nothing of left or right, equality or inequality. You aren't getting quality institutions by buying what any side sells, and you get massive amounts of state control both ways. It's just a matter of whether the massive state control is going in areas you don't mind it on, or areas where it's really annoying to you.</p>
<p>If you are trying to have even the thinnest grip of reality, you should doubt your friends as much as your foes, and the author here just doesn't really doubt their friends at all.</p>

<p>Tyler is speaking positively of Kamala Harris and negatively of Trump. I'd say he is picking sides. Tyler has also been rather partisan Democrat for his career.</p>
<p>I'd like to ask the economists, what they think of the economics of Kamala Harris:</p>
<p>- She wanted to ban fracking and offshore drilling. Her campaign recently denies this, but relatively recently, Kamala Harris is publicly pledging to ban fracking and offshore drilling.<br />
- On health care, Kamala Harris pledged to eliminating private health insurance and medicare for all.<br />
- Kamala Harris supported the Green New Deal.<br />
- She praised Randi Weingarten, the President of AFT, and the legacy teacher labor unions.<br />
- She had the furthest left voting record in the senate.</p>
<p>Tyler wrote last December, that discussing the 2024 election will make you stupid (https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/12/designed-to-make-you-stupid.html). How about discussing the economics of the proposed economic policy?</p>
</blockquote><p>Fracking damages the environment and many farmers hate it.</p>

<p>Testing the raw milk is a no-brainer. Since pasteurization kills the virus, non-pharmaceutical interventions should be effective without the need for culling.

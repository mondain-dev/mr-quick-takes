</blockquote><p>In fact, this seems like it sort of has to happen.   For areas that are male-dominated, like engineering, there's not necessarily much career value for going beyond a BA/BS.  For areas that are female-dominated, like education, psychology, and social work, an MA or professional degree is more useful career-wise.<br />
So it could just be that the "baseline college education" is different for male- and female- dominated careers and that shows up as decreased hypogamy.</p>

<p>I think it's important to understand that if avian flu does become transmissible between humans, it will have different features than COVID. And lessons learned from COVID may or may not apply.</p>
<p>A notable feature of COVID is that the older your age, the higher your risk of death. The very young - children - were spared. This is not how, say, the Spanish Flu worked. There, healthy young people with good immune systems died because of cytokine storms. And most diseases throughout history definitely did not spare the very young. We are not prepared emotionally for a pandemic that kills kids. </p>
<p>I do worry that if this thing spreads to people, we'll treat it like COVID when in fact it would likely follow different rules.</p>

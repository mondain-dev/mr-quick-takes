<p>1. The Vivek 'Boy Meets World' Post, with its bizarre cultural confusions, the insane assertion that the US would be better off if we all adopted this stupid Tiger Mom student-as-slave mentality, and that this would somehow be a road to national greatness</p>
<p>2. The very real and nuanced H1b debate, which has to contend with the fact that a lot of Big Tech uses H1B labor as exploited indentured labor, people who can be deported if fired from a particular firm, etc.</p>
<p>It also has to contend with the point - made by Laura Loomer of all people - that AI boosters (like Big Tech, and TC himself!) are all telling us that AI is about to be able to do everyone's job, starting in the very first place with the coders jobs! If this is true, why do we desperately need to import millions of coders from India??</p>
<p>Obviously racial abuse is horrifying and should be condemned, but Tyler should also engage with many of the deeper issues here!</p>

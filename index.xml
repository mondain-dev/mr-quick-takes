</blockquote><p>Excellent, excellent comment. People used to laugh at the religious right back in the 80's when they bemoaned the weakening of the moral fabric of society, but they were absolutely right. All of the liberal Enlightenment values that ever American takes for granted can only exist in a polity that's composed of fundamentally decent high-IQ people. That's the unappreciated social infrastructure that makes our polyglot culture possible and we have let it completely decay. We have torched the commons of collective American identity and have passed the tipping point. The fuse on the demographic bomb has been lit and there's no going back. America is in inexorable Idiocratic decline and in 40 years we'll be a richer version of Argentina. Oh well, it was nice while it lasted.</p>

But there is the opening sentence: "Bucking his central planning instincts, Obama embraced a surprisingly laissez-faire approach to space flight that angered political allies and opponents alike."</p>
<p>Obama accomplished this so early in his presidency that anyone who thought Obama was hostile toward markets and had "central planning instincts" was not basing that impression on any actual evidence.</p>
<p>That said, the policy still was not "laissez-faire." It was part privatization, part government-sponsored R&amp;D because NASA paid SpaceX upfront in order to fund and subsidize their development of heavy lift rockets and crew capsules. SpaceX pays back NASA over time with launches. It is highly unlikely any private VCs or telecom companies would have given SpaceX funding on the same generous terms.</p>

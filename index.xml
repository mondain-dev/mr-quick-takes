<p>With Trump, he wants things to grow. He'll listen to anyone that tells him they can make it grow (everyone else bed damned), so markets like that. He's got other downsides but he's focused on the American economy and like other posters have mentioned here, the US economy doing well means the rest of the world does well - so Trump tariffs might weirdly be good?</p>

In an ageing population you would expect crime to follow a secular downward trend. Same in basically all European countries. So failing crime rates is actually the baseline.</p>
<p>Another data point is high (above average) crime rates of immigrant populations. Just because ‚Äúcrime is falling‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean you should add criminality to remain at a ‚Äúnatural rate of crime‚Äù or something. Less crime = good, more crime = bad. The ideal number is 0, and anything that adds to crime (w/o a compensating benefit) is bad. </p>
<p>Let me try an analogy. Even if you get a big raise at your job, you can never go wrong by cutting expenses on lottery tickets, vape pens and malt 40 liquor.</p>

</blockquote><p>Some biologists think the whole idea of female orgasm is a myth. What they experience is not orgasm in the strict sense of the word, but simply a very sharp itch. In some way this should have been obvious, since so-called female orgasm is functionally so unlike male orgasm, in that it can be experienced multiple times in quick succession (no refractory) and also that nothing comes out. Calling it "orgasm" is biologically inaccurate because there is neither homology nor analogy between male orgasm and female "orgasm".</p>

<p>Especially since according to another Post article, it is hurting the Trump campaign in swing states. "By including Harris ‚Äî who has two stepchildren ‚Äî in his 2021 description of ascendant Democrats as ‚Äúa bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable,‚Äù Vance seems to have triggered anger not only among voters who support her, but also among swing voters, who suddenly feel inspired to defend her."</p>

</blockquote><p>It reveals an unsavory aspect of American culture, namely that we are aggressively mean to losers. </p>
<p>Think about it. A "loser" is someone who lost. Without knowing anything else about how they lost, shouldn't the default reaction be pity an sympathy? Yet "loser" is used as a pejorative to express contempt. It's not possible to say "look at her, what a poor loser!" because it simultaneously expresses sympathy and contempt for the same person, which are not compatible attitudes.</p>

<p>Democrats have long been the party of neurotic females. When they aren‚Äôt bemoaning their lack of successful relationships, the nonexistent pay gap, the student loan crisis resulting from their communications degree, or the ever increasing price of their antidepressant meds, they are at home with their cats and rescue dogs</p>
</blockquote><p>"Washington Post data scientist reveals that yes, in fact, water is wet."</p>
<p>It's a category error to call water "wet". Things are wet because of the presence of water content.  Water is the cause of wetness, but it cannot itself have that property.</p>

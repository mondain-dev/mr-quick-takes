</blockquote><p>There used to be a satirical political party in Canada called the Rhinoceros Party. As part of their official platform, they promised to invade Belgium if elected, because the Belgian cartoon character Tintin once shot a rhino. However, they said they would call off the invasion if the Belgian embassy delivered a case of mussles and Belgian beer to party headquarters. Apparently, the embassy did this.</p>

Moreover, "labor share" of income includes the compensation paid to CEOs and others with income significantly higher than the compensation paid to the average worker. Indeed, it even includes the income realized by Elon Musk and other executives with non-qualified stock options upon the exercise of those options (such income measured by the difference between the value of the stock upon exercise of the options and the option price for the stock), but it does not include the increase in the value of the stock after exercise of the options. Given the popularity of compensating highly paid executives with non-qualified stock options and the rise of stock prices, "labor share" is skewed to the upper level of compensation. Finally, and most significantly for "workers" at the lower end of compensation, the fluctuations (i.e., decline) in investment in "productive capital" here in the U.S. has greatly affected labor productivity and, hence, their compensation. while not significantly affecting the compensation of executives whose compensation is determined in large part by "profits" (including profits earned overseas) and the rise in stock prices. Thus, "labor share" isn't the best gauge for determining  the "relative" condition of workers (relative to capital share).</p>
</blockquote><p>Recall the fun with Elon several years ago when he needed to exercise soon-to-lapse stock options. He announced his intentions to exercise the stock options and took a poll (on Twitter) asking his millions of fans if he should sell some of his Tesla stock to exercise the options. It wasn't clear if reaaly cared what his fans think or if he was simply manipulating the price of Tesla stock: on the one hand, he wanted the price to fall before he exercised the options so his income on exercise of the options (and his income tax liability) would be lower, but on the other hand, a falling stock price would require his to sell more shares to pay the option price. The man is smarter than the average bear, and I assume he hit the sweet spot of a rising and falling stock price (whatever he considered the sweet spot). This episode involved billions, not some paltry sum that might be paid to "labor" even though his income on the exercises was included in "labor share". My point of this specific is the same as my point of the general, "labor share" (or labour share" if you prefer) is an ambiguous term.</p>

<p>Obvious examples are big tech, big pharma, and so on.  But I think it's even true for consumer products companies.  Anybody can make a cola that tastes reasonable, but really only 2 companies compete in the cola/diet cola market in the US.  If you want Oreo, Pop-Tarts, WD-40, or a Weber grill, you don't have a lot of choices.  And the owners of those brands capture the higher margins and pass them on to shareholders.</p>
</blockquote><p>This is mostly advertising and branding init?  All of the brands you mention are relentless advertisers.  Another brand in this category recently stumbled badly in its marketing and lost a good share of it's sales: budweiser.  </p>
<p>Another reason all these brands are competing only in twos and threes is that they don't actually make that much money because their core businesses are growing slowly if at all.  Cola and beer, for sure, are on the outs these days in the US and Europe, although they are growing in international markets.  Same with cookies and pop tarts.  And WD-40 isn't much use on your computer.  </p>
<p>I'm sure if Tyler wanted to introduce a delicious Cowen Cola he could bring it up to speed with Coke and Pepsi with sufficient investment.  But with the market for cola plateauing, he wouldn't make very much money.</p>

</blockquote><p>The Altair was for computer scientists and hobbyists, which needed to be built from a kit. 25,000 were sold. Commodore's PET and Apple were launched in 1977 and it took until 1978 when hundreds of thousands were sold. 600,000 home/business computers were sold in 1979.</p>
<p>As for being useful, I'd say closer to 1980 to 1982 since word processors and spreadsheets were common.</p>

<p><i>"Israel retains studiously open channels with all of the major powers"</i></p>

<p><i>"Israel; Memberships: Complicated; Coalition Members: Complicated"</i>.</p>
<p>No other high income country is classified as "complicated" btw. Perhaps this is a limitation of a only a small group of high income countries, with entangled histories and geographical circumstances, and if places like Turkey make the pivot to high income, more "complicated" will start to appear.</p>

I'd stress that this is 'for now'. I could foresee China attempting to disrupt the dollar as THE safe haven by continuing to acquire gold and then at some point pegging the renminbi to gold. Already, they are trying to convince Russia and Saudi Arabia to trade oil for their currency (and they are to a degree already). They have even set up an alternate to the US SWIFT system for oil transactions.</p>
<p>Once Chinese currency becomes a greater share of oil and gold transactions by Russia and the Saudis, it will only be a matter of time before all of the OPEC countries adopt its use. Once that happens, the horse is out of the barn and good luck closing those doors.</p>

<p>As a proxy, from the ratio of <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?end=2022&amp;locations=EU-XC-GB-FR-JP-PL-US-CN-TR&amp;start=1991" rel="nofollow ugc">nominal market exchange GDP</a> to <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.KD?end=2022&amp;locations=EU-XC-GB-FR-JP-PL-US-CN&amp;start=1991" rel="nofollow ugc">PPP constant dollars GDP</a> (as given by World Bank), setting the US at 100%, to infer the general price level relative to US (not exactly the same as exchange rate on a particular currency, but close enough for the purposes of cross comparison):</p>
<p>1991: Japan: 142%; United Kingdom: 108%; France: 104%; Eurozone (states as of 2024): 95.5%; European Union (states as of 2024): 90.7%; China: 38%; Turkey: 36%; Poland 35%.</p>
<p>2000: Japan: 149%; United Kingdom: 101.1%; France: 78%; Eurozone: 70.3%; European Union: 65.9%; Turkey: 39%; China: 38%; Poland 38%.</p>
<p>2008: Japan: 117%; United Kingdom: 124%; France: 121%; Eurozone: 110%; European Union: 106%; Poland 71.5%; Turkey: 62%; China: 53%.</p>
<p>2022: United Kingdom: 82.1%; France: 75%; Eurozone (states as of 2024): 72.1%; European Union (countries in the EU as of 2024): 68.9%; Japan: 69%; China: 59%; Poland 42%; Turkey: 27%.</p>
<p>Some are down 1991-2008, however the price level relative to EU as a whole is not too dissimilar to the Y2K / DotCom era, and China is kind of where you might expect given the levels of economic growth.</p>
<p>If US inflation and interest rates calm down a bit, net of that, the USD may not prove to be necessarily overvalued?</p>

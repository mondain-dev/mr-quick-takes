Lower wages lead to lower inflation. Lower inflation leads to lower interest rates. Lower interest rates lead to lower borrowing costs and higher asset prices.<br />
This is why the administration is importing millions of people. It is an attempt to reduce inflation, which is the number one political issue among voters.</p>

<p>In most cases, either minor tweaks to existing laws and regulations or transparency requirements would seem to handle most of the cases that are concerning, while still allowing for interesting uses.</p>
<p>E.g. make sure that "deep fakes" are properly covered under existing fraud / libel / revenge-porn laws.  We already have (pretty good, not perfect) mechanisms for dealing with tension between art, free speech, libel, marketing ... do these really need more than some fine-tuning for the AI case?</p>
<p>E.g. For AI in employment, promotion, admissions, insurance, criminal justice etc. it is probably sufficient to require transparency with respect to inputs and outputs and allow anyone to verify and test the models. </p>
<p>There are plenty of organizations that will be happy, even eager, to test for discrimination, stupidity or bugs (if only to discredit rival products..</p>
<p>E.g. for many applications, clarifying ordinary liability should be reasonable (e.g. medical decision making).</p>

The Act defines “artificial intelligence models” as machine-based systems that can make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments and which can formulate options for information or action. However, the Act does not emphasize AI models generally – rather, it focuses specifically on AI models that it defines as a “covered AI model.” These covered models are those that meet one or both of the following requirements: (1) the model was trained using a quantity of computing power greater than 10^26 integer or floating-point operations or (2) the model has similar performance to that of a state-of-the-art foundation model."</p>
<p>"Safety assessment requirement: Under the Act, developers would be required to assess safety before training a “covered AI model,” ensuring that the models are safe and do not pose a risk to public safety or welfare. This involves making a positive safety determination that the model does not have the capability to enable certain harms, such as the creation of chemical or biological weapons that would result in mass casualties or a cyberattack on critical infrastructure resulting in $500 million or more in damage."</p>
<p>"Third-party model testing: Developers of covered AI models are required to implement a written safety and security protocol which provides sufficient detail for third parties to test the safety of the models they develop."</p>
<p>"Shutdown capability: Under the Act, developers are required to implement a shutdown capability for AI models when such models have not obtained a positive safety determination. This means that developers must be able to deactivate or restrict the AI model's functionalities until they are able to obtain such a determination."</p>
<p>That's from a summary of SB-1047 prepared by the international firm DLA Piper. As one can see, the proposed Act isn't nearly as broad as the alarmists are indicating. What's going on here is the industry, having grown accustomed to its immunity from liability pursuant to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, recoiling from an effort to prevent the industry from evading liability for damages caused by a limited number of A.I. systems. Indeed, the Act proposed in California is limited, distinguishing A.I. systems that have the capability to enable the kind of harm the Act covers. The "nefarious" actor scenario described in the blog post is a red herring.</p>

These companies seem to manage to get a workforce to maintain profitable production.</p>
<p>I think it's perhaps the aversion to local large scale capital investment, particularly in local manufacturing brands.</p>
<p>Capital in Britain seems to prefer to foreign direct investment in overseas industry, or in more agile and service based models in the UK.</p>
<p>The UK is quite open to capital investment and to capital exports, and at the same time, perhaps foreign producers have more muscle to get a good deal from the UK than local capitalists believe that they will get.</p>
<p>It might be that this is actually a wise decision though; car manufacturing is an awfully internationally competitive business, and every industrialising power enters the chat one after the other. If it's not the Italians, its the Japanese, then its the Koreans, then it's the Chinese, then its the Indians.</p>
<p>At some point maybe you do just go "Look, we're going to build Jaguars and Land Rovers and sell them at a high margin as luxury vehicles, at these facilities that require lower levels of investment".</p>
<p>Of course these mass market autos are great symbols of manufacturing prowess, great adverts for the country. But it's also a very competitive market.</p>

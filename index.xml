<p>Carpe diem, baby. The Anglosphere is embarking on a Great Pivot.

<p>Don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Time to build. Pitter patter, let's get at'er. YMMV.</p>

<p>If you're comparing to US corps, no, Australia doesn't have that because it has one company in the world's top 100 companies whilte the US has over 60 in the top 100.  Australia does not have a single major company in any aspect of technology and it's only top 100 co is BHP, a mining company.  </p>
<p>So the obvious reason Australian CEO's would be at the bottom of the pay barrel is because, appart from BHP, they're at the bottom of the value barrel and mostly unable to compete outside Australia</p>

Back when the numbers of homeless were so much smaller, among the men - the women were always obviously crazy - you kind of got an "urban outdoorsman" vibe. They actually carried their stuff on their back, instead of in five shopping carts and a kiddie bike roped together. They seemed to know and practice the art, many of them, of blending in.<br />
I remember walking through a park and noticing a couple homeless guys actually cooking a squirrel on the charcoal grill.<br />
It doesn't seem much like that now.<br />
Even when they are sitting around, in their chairs, with a rug and a TV, on the actual overpass of the freeway, smiling and laughing - they remind me most of the crazy guy who used to be in the laundromate all the time when I was doing laundry, *pretending* to hold a conversation on the payphone. For hours.<br />
I do think they have some skills, though. They are hardy, obviously, and to an extent brave since one of them kills another one approximately every four or five days, you know, just like their community was Stars Hollow. </p>
<p>But overall, the salient fact is they are drawn to precincts where rich people are. Full stop. They are never anywhere else but there. </p>
<p>That's not something you could have ever said about a "frontiersman".</p>

<p>I'm aware.  The media was full of critiques of the care of the mentally ill in those days.  The film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a famous example.</p>
<p>FWIW, I don't think this was some fringe thing back when it was done.   People really thought it would be better.</p>
<p>The climate is changing today.  But even now, you see people who still defend drug legalization and decriminalization, for example.  We aren't out of the woods yet.  Probably drug abuse is the worse problem than mental illness today, but both are important.</p>

<p>But I don't really see how it can be such a factor explain a lower trend growth specifically after about 2006. It's very "Just So", and there's a reason why it's little invoked in academic analyses of the productivity trend.</p>
<p>If you even believe these stories about how planning permission makes everything impossible relative to a zoning system. Back when World Bank used to publish a <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IC.WRH.DURS?locations=1W-GB-US-JP-FR-DE" rel="nofollow ugc"><br />
Time required to build a warehouse (days)</a> metric as part of their Ease of Doing Business project, they found that UK had a similar time to USA. The burden of planning permission regulations between countries are not so easily comparable to estimate their impact.</p>
<p>Alternatively OECD gives a measure of Land Governance Regulation within housing policy toolkit (see <a href="https://www.oecd.org/housing/policy-toolkit/country-snapshots/housing-policy-united-kingdom.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc">here</a> for UK). And while the UK is high on this, it has little relationship with housing costs - <a href="https://i.imgur.com/bOL1zu9.png" rel="nofollow ugc">graph</a> - with countries such as Canada and Ireland with high costs scoring low on their index.</p>

I'd add that in general, we should downgrade individual people's political beliefs significantly in our assessments of them. Unless you're an academic or policy/politics professional, the amount you actually know is close to nil. Random people's views have near zero impact on the world. And they usually have at least one batshit political position that doesn't make sense. Just ignore all of it.</p>
<p>Much more important is how they deal with people interpersonally. How do they treat  or talk about their parents, siblings, friends, and the waitress or barista on your date? How do they treat you? How do they use their time and what's important to them? These things are usually not too related to politics, and also make a real difference in a relationship.</p>

For my money, what makes Tyler worthwhile are his eclectic interests and his ability to engage with guests of varied backgrounds in a way that transcends the boilerplate and superficial. Were his schtick simply repeating the greatest hits of libertarians of yore, I'd be critical!</p>

As a fellow autodidact, I really feel a struggle in Hughes to assert his own voice rather than to put out a pastiche or tapestry of the voices of others in order to connect.  Hughes' vocabulary and mien were all focused (he might say monomaniacally) on matching and mirroring Tyler's.  I used to do that. Mohammed Ali's line was float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. But Ali had a firm voice, and his miming was an overlay and a strategy, not the main thing. Hughes is floating so nothing hits him directly. And his own convos podcast, conceptually, just doubles down on the matching and mirroring thing.  On the other hand, the Tyler convo with Haidt shows another possibility in convos that I very much doubt Hughes is ready to show.  In my mid-thirties, a therapist changed my life when he said my own habits of miming and mirroring were dangerous long term.  I hope Hughes sees that someday too and starts to assert his own voice politically. Doing so might move him further from a Beastie Boy, closer to an Eminem.</p>

<p>The problem is that those that have said this before are gone. It's important to have a person able to go onto The View and discuss these things so that a new batch of housewives can get the exposure. Sadly, in the last 10 years we've gone from treating everyone the same to giving those with a certain hair type a big advantage at every phase of life. From college admission to jobs. And the 20-something thinks this is a good thing. They have zero understanding this was precisely what Jim Crow was. Because people like MLK aren't around to go on The View and talk about this. </p>
<p>I just re-watched Milton Friedman on Phil Donohue from 1979. What an excellent interview (he was on twice). TC probably isn't saying anything new either. But he can go out and channel Friedman on some topics. And that's important. And Friedman wasn't new either. "I, Pencil" was written by someone I don't remember. But Friedman took and and used it as a very effective teaching tool.</p>
<p>Nothing is new. It's all about having a stable of folks that can channel these messages to the masses.</p>

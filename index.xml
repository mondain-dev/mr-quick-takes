Take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyendra_Nath_Bose" rel="nofollow ugc">Satyendra Nath Bose</a>. </p>
<p>Do we take the view that he was some incredible once-in-a-century outlier of Indian "natural talent" who just happened to occur when he did? Or that he benefitted from a lot of being in the right proximity to the right research networks, at the right time, and there are plenty of people in India with equal natural talent? </p>
<p>And if we take a view closer to the latter, IMO a more sensible view, then we must bear in mind that we must apply it across the board.</p>
<p>These network effects are IMO why the estimation of any population ability level from some prize is a bad idea. No, Jewish Israelis are not worse at math than we think from their (mediocre) PISA scores because they have not very impressive performance in the International Mathematical Olmypiad (compared to, say, Romania). No, Israelis are not great at math because they have higher performance in Fields Medals than their PISA scores would suggest. Etc.</p>

<p>Just from reading his wikipedia, he seems to have benefited a lot from contacting Einstein regarding his discoveries and from Einstein's recognition of the importance of his work.  </p>
<p>I wouldn't say the distribution of Nobels reflects population *ability*, but it probably *does* reflect national investment in science (physics labs and equipment is expensive), which in turn plays back into what researchers are able to investigate and the kinds of things they specialize in.  </p>
<p>A line in the Wikipedia article you referenced may elude to India having very limited funds for physics research:</p>
<p>"[Bose]  insisted every student design their own equipment using local materials and local technicians. "</p>
<p>Wow!  On the one hand, people surely have to be very bright, creative and resourceful to build their own equipment from local materials!  On the other, surely this is very limiting as to the kinds of research people can do.  It suggests that there was virtually no investment in physics research on the part of the government - probably not much of a surprise given that, at the time, India was poor and hungry. </p>
<p>So the distribution fo prizes may not measure ability, but it could be very roughly relevant to productivity.</p>

So did my ancestors' neighbors in Britain until the Romans mostly stopped it. As Rome fell my ancestors kidnapped a young Roman citizen teenager named Patricius and brought him back to their home to tend sheep. He escaped to France and came back 20+- years later to covert my savage ancestors to Christianity while building monasteries and copying books.</p>
<p>IAC, ritual human sacrifice was halted and replaced by reading paperback bodice rippers.</p>
<p>They rest is history ... so they say ...</p>

To the degree that there are men who serial date and "oligopolize" large numbers of women (and I think it's often overblown, but maybe a real thing), the described phenom at the link is the necessary corollary of the "incels" complaint about this.</p>
<p>"Protecting Women And Girls" blather is always more likely to actually get something done though, so perhaps that would be a shift in marketing strategy for folks who wish to promote early monogamous marriage that would work better than showing the slightest concern for single young men.</p>

Specifically:  </p>
<p>1) Repair or replace bridges that are past their useful lifespan or have low rates on inspections. Think of it this way: One of the biggest military assets in any invasion is the bridges. By failing to maintain or replace these, we are essentially declaring war on ourselves and suffering some of the consequences of an enemy invasion merely through our own sloth. The warnings about bridge collapses are remarkably similar to the warnings about the New Orleans levies I heard prior to Katrina--experts shouting as loudly as they can "This will kill people!!" and everyone ignoring them because no one's died yet. As a bonus, this is a way to get bipartisan support--more efficient construction methods would decrease ecological impact and environmental costs, while also increasing blue-collar work for decades. </p>
<p>2) The electrical grid. We CANNOT transmit enough electricity to power the future; in some cases we can't even power today. An astonishing amount of our electrical grid is past its useful lifespan as well. The future will be more energy intensive. We should be building the infrastructure to handle this load now, rather than reactively building in response to disasters. </p>
<p>3) Mine asteroids. This is a bit pie-in-the-sky, but the rewards would be tremendous so I'd think it's worth trying. The elements we need to build existing technology, to say nothing of future technology, are considered rare-earth elements because they fell below the crust during the fractionation the Earth went through as it cooled. Asteroids did not undergo that process, and key elements that are rare on Earth are practically as common as iron in these asteroids. We know we can grab material and bring it back; we know we can manipulate asteroid orbital paths. Let's park one in orbit (around the Moon or at a LaGrange point, so it doesn't smack into our planet accidently) and mine the sucker.</p>

There’s really nothing these men can do if women in the 3-9 range keep sleeping with male 10s in the hopes of eventually ensnaring one. The male 10s will eventually settle down, if at all, with a female 10, but in the meantime they’re happy to sleep with the 3-10s. This is an equilibrium that only women can break.</p>

<p>Sounds reasonable and rational but is (also) a bit illustrative for the average academic. Its not that in industry people are impatient (relative to academia) because they are short-sighted or dumb, its because time has an (opportunity) cost in competitive markets and not (so much) in academia. </p>
<p>I am sure that in industry people sometimes cut too many corners, however making things too complicated and too convoluted has its own costs.</p>

<p>In all seriousness, the irony here is that this Tweet is supposed to be directed at a certain liberal or left wing subset of academia, but it equally applies to academics like Tyler who are wasting their entire waking lives on social media dancing like monkeys for engagement in like minded bubbles.</p>

Claims about social resilience (NYT)."</p>
<p>This brings to mind a couple of concepts.  </p>
<p>Though Taleb is more of a crank than insightful, "anti-fragile" is a good way to summarize the resilient cultures.  The ones that developed anti-fragile infrastructures and mechanisms survived, or at least bounced back faster.</p>
<p>I'd guess that there are analogies here with the evolution of species within given ecological niches?  If the local area stays stable, the local organisms can evolve to maximize their survival and reproduction in that niche; maybe they're the resident orca pods in Puget Sound that specialize in eating salmon, that used to be plentiful there.</p>
<p>Which is great while it lasts, their salmon-eating lifestyles helped them thrive over less-specialized species.</p>
<p>But Puget Sound in the 21st and late 20th century has a lot less salmon (and more pollution and boat traffic) and the local orca population is threatened -- while transient orca pods that wander in and out of Puget Sound, and that do not limit themselves to eating salmon, are doing fine.</p>
<p>In a changing ecological environment, the anti-fragile orca populations are doing better.  In a stable one, the resident population thrived.</p>
<p>The other concept that might be relevant here is the agriculture-versus-hunter-gatherer article that Tyler linked to a couple of weeks ago.  If your region is subject to frequent disruption, you're better off having technologies and lifestyles -- such as agriculture -- that enable you to ride out those tough times.  </p>
<p>With more reliable weather, local game, and local plants, you might instead benefit from the higher average productivity of the hunter-gatherer lifestyle.  But now you're more vulnerable to changes in climate or severe weather or even just seasonality.<br />

<p>Indians are over-represented and under-achievers (not talented enough or doing something wrong) in many other fields despite being 18% of the world population.

<p>Just from reading his wikipedia, he seems to have benefited a lot from contacting Einstein regarding his discoveries and from Einstein's recognition of the importance of his work.  </p>
<p>I wouldn't say the distribution of Nobels reflects population *ability*, but it probably *does* reflect national investment in science (physics labs and equipment is expensive), which in turn plays back into what researchers are able to investigate and the kinds of things they specialize in.  </p>
<p>A line in the Wikipedia article you referenced may elude to India having very limited funds for physics research:</p>
<p>"[Bose]  insisted every student design their own equipment using local materials and local technicians. "</p>
<p>Wow!  On the one hand, people surely have to be very bright, creative and resourceful to build their own equipment from local materials!  On the other, surely this is very limiting as to the kinds of research people can do.  It suggests that there was virtually no investment in physics research on the part of the government - probably not much of a surprise given that, at the time, India was poor and hungry. </p>
<p>So the distribution fo prizes may not measure ability, but it could be very roughly relevant to productivity.</p>

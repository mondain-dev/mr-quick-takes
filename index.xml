Look how long it took to go from the first personal computer ( the Altair 8080 in 74  ) to a machine on every desk,  actually useful for personal and business tasks , arguably 1990</p>
</blockquote><p>The Altair was for computer scientists and hobbyists, which needed to be built from a kit. 25,000 were sold. Commodore's PET and Apple were launched in 1977 and it took until 1978 when hundreds of thousands were sold. 600,000 home/business computers were sold in 1979.</p>
<p>As for being useful, I'd say closer to 1980 to 1982 since word processors and spreadsheets were common.</p>

<p><i>"Israel retains studiously open channels with all of the major powers"</i></p>
<p>Table classifying alliance relationships for high incomes countries around the world provides:</p>
<p><i>"Israel; Memberships: Complicated; Coalition Members: Complicated"</i>.</p>
<p>No other high income country is classified as "complicated" btw. Perhaps this is a limitation of a only a small group of high income countries, with entangled histories and geographical circumstances, and if places like Turkey make the pivot to high income, more "complicated" will start to appear.</p>

Because they provide strategic military footholds for the US, but Israel more so, capable of acting unilaterally against Iran, for example.

I'd stress that this is 'for now'. I could foresee China attempting to disrupt the dollar as THE safe haven by continuing to acquire gold and then at some point pegging the renminbi to gold. Already, they are trying to convince Russia and Saudi Arabia to trade oil for their currency (and they are to a degree already). They have even set up an alternate to the US SWIFT system for oil transactions.</p>
<p>Once Chinese currency becomes a greater share of oil and gold transactions by Russia and the Saudis, it will only be a matter of time before all of the OPEC countries adopt its use. Once that happens, the horse is out of the barn and good luck closing those doors.</p>

<p>1991: Japan: 142%; United Kingdom: 108%; France: 104%; Eurozone (states as of 2024): 95.5%; European Union (states as of 2024): 90.7%; China: 38%; Turkey: 36%; Poland 35%.</p>
<p>2000: Japan: 149%; United Kingdom: 101.1%; France: 78%; Eurozone: 70.3%; European Union: 65.9%; Turkey: 39%; China: 38%; Poland 38%.</p>

<p>2022: United Kingdom: 82.1%; France: 75%; Eurozone (states as of 2024): 72.1%; European Union (countries in the EU as of 2024): 68.9%; Japan: 69%; China: 59%; Poland 42%; Turkey: 27%.</p>
<p>Some are down 1991-2008, however the price level relative to EU as a whole is not too dissimilar to the Y2K / DotCom era, and China is kind of where you might expect given the levels of economic growth.</p>
<p>If US inflation and interest rates calm down a bit, net of that, the USD may not prove to be necessarily overvalued?</p>

<p>https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/behavior/sunday-firesides-stop-the-vivisection-of-beauty/</p>
<p>Part of the hate is the idea that you can engineer life. It's tempting--I'm a project manager, and believe me, it's tempting to use those skills in my personal life. But the VAST majority of people do not like being engineered. A certain amount of intentionality is necessary in a romantic relationship, sure, but a certain amount needs to be organic. How much of each is something that each couple needs to decide for themselves. </p>
<p>Reminds me of the guy who wrote "Getting Things Done". He said in the book that he and his wife put things in each other's "In" box, as a sign of respect for the other person's time. Works for them I guess--if you marry someone who's job is to design productivity systems you sort of have to expect this sort of behavior--but it's not going to be something that most people will tolerate.</p>
<p>As a project manager I have certain resources and certain concrete goals, and my job is to accomplish those goals within those resources. And romantic relationships simply are not like that. Getting to know another person is a lifelong endeavor. Building a life with someone isn't something you can expect a 6% margin on. These tools can be applied to some limited aspects of romantic relationships--like, I'm putting together a cost estimate for some remodeling, and the tools I use at work are as good a framework as anything else--but how do you forecast the love you feel for a child? Once you break down love into critical path items it stops being love. </p>
<p>If it works for him and his spouse that's fantastic for them. Seriously, it's great! But the idea that it's going to be widely applicable defies pretty much everything we know about human nature. Every relationship is unique, and every relationship has to find its own equilibrium.</p>
</blockquote><p>The thing is if you are really, really, really effing busy, you actually DO need to schedule time for important things like "find someone to marry and have kids with". It's a really problem for very busy people. And it actually is useful at that point to manage it using the same tools you would use for project management.<br />
Project: find romantic partner before too old to have kids. Schedule: coffee dates with these 10 people I picked off of OK Cupid. Etc. </p>
<p>Same thing if you have kids already and need to schedule time for "date nights" to keep from getting a divorce. You have to arrange baby sitters, get tickets or reservations for wherever. Maybe rent a hotel room for a night. Whatever. Two people with full time jobs and three kids that have soccer, dance, swim, music whatever lessons requires time management. The fact that their lives are that busy and they need this is not a ding against their personalities.</p>

<p>First level:  Musk is a genius, he'll improve Twitter.</p>
<p>Second level (where I'm at):  Musk is impulsive and id-driven, and made a seat-of-the-pants decision, and a very bad one, and has lost tens of billions of dollars in lost Twitter value.</p>
<p>Third level (what you're hypothesizing):  this was Musk's game all along, to eliminate Twitter as a relevant player in society.  </p>
<p>Tyler is such a fan-boy of Musk that he accused Musk's critics of having Elon Derangement Syndrome.  I wonder if Tyler is clinging to this level 3 hypothesis. </p>
<p>However, Tyler was and is a fan of Twitter, pre- and post-Musk, so I don't see Tyler being in favor of Musk's Twitter-destroying strategy, if indeed that's what Musk is trying to do.</p>
</blockquote><p>Yeah, I don't think Tyler thinks Musk is intentionally destroying Twitter as a favor to society. But to me, it seem obvious. He renamed it "X" for example. Come on. That's telegraphing "I'm planning to ruin this thing" right off the bat.</p>

<p>In Jesse David Fox's 2024 Comedy Book, Jerry Seinfeld and his humor is given much attention. </p>
<p>Fox writes, "Comedy Central’s head of research, Chanon Cook, speaking about a 2012 survey she conducted, which showed that millennials viewed humor as the number-one factor in their self-definition. “Comedy is to this generation what music was to previous generations,” she told me. “They use it to define themselves. They use it to connect with people.” Comedy Central called them Comedy Natives.</p>
<p>"By 2014, comedy was seen as so important politically that when the Obama administration was desperate to boost Affordable Care Act enrollment, their bright idea was to have the president appear on Zach Galifianakis’s talk show parody, Between Two Ferns, which featured jokes like “What is it like to be the last Black president?” And it worked, with the Healthcare.gov site experiencing a 40 percent boost in traffic, almost entirely made up of people who had never visited the site before. The American socialist magazine Jacobin would later call it “The Day Zach Galifianakis Saved Obamacare.”</p>
<p>It is truly astonishing that comedy is so important to this generation.</p>

"If you stay at a job that you don't like, that's your fault!"</p>
</blockquote><p>There is, of course, an intense survivorship bias in graduation speakers.  Who knows how many other aspiring comedians started out at the same time as Seinfeld, desperate to succeed in a 'cool job' and living on peanut butter?   The vast majority never made it and may have wasted irrecoverable years pursing an unrealizable dream.  But graduates only hear from one of the tiny few with the right combination of talent and luck to end up vastly rich and successful.  Well, hopefully, the graduates have the good sense to ignore that part of his advice.  And it's still, one of the better graduation speeches I've ever heard.</p>

</blockquote><p>Yes. Every time this conversation comes up, I have a hard time grokking what the exact definition of elite is. Tyler seems to be defaulting to the definition offered by Murray and Hanania and other assorted reactionaries, but I don't see why we ought to accept that one.</p>
<p>By their telling, an assistant professor at at Tier 1 university is part of the elite while the owner of a large car dealership is not. And yet, there are laws in effect making it illegal for car manufacturers to sell directly to consumers. So why should I accept that the guy hanging on to the lower rungs of the academy, making $90 grand a year with no tenure yet is part of the elite, while the guy clearing seven figures and has laws specifically limiting his competition and who can get his congressman on the phone is not part of the elite.</p>

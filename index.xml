</blockquote><p>Very good point.  To drive this home a little more pointedly, Alex could (should) have mentioned that the previous Starbucks CEO, Laxman Narasimhan, lasted a bit more than one year.  During his tenure, Starbucks lost about $32 billion in market value.  Is Starbuck's partial rebound due to Niccol's talent, or Laxman's lack of it?  Laxman N. was also paid very handsomely, particularly considering after his disastrous tenure he may earn as much as $21 million for that stint, including his severance.</p>
<p>If you want to argue that CEO's "earn their pay", then an honest appraisal needs to consider both the good with the bad performers.  </p>
<p>My take on this is that CEO's deserve to be paid  very well for stellar performance.  But, if you want to argue they "earn" that pay, then they should not be rewarded for their mistakes.  As it stands, CEO pay packages don't reflect that.</p>

As a society we're so scared to let kids have any liberty that people have been arrested for simply allowing their kids to play outside, in a fenced yard, on a comfortable day, while the parent was inside. And once Americans are fed up with something we do tend to swing quite wildly in the other direction. </p>
<p>Plus, I think we're re-evaluating some priorities as a culture. A lot of us parents grew up in a time when it seemed like bad things just didn't happen anymore. Then 9/11 occurred, school shootings became more of a media staple (the rate at which they occur doesn't seem to correlate with the amount of discussion they get), we had a pandemic, Russia did its level best to start World War 3, etc. We grew up with the genuine belief that we could control our environment and make life safe, and that illusion has been thoroughly shattered. Makes sense that we're going back to accepting a certain amount of risk as part of growing up. </p>
<p>Americans have always valued liberty over security. It's one of the biggest cultural differences between us and Europe, and one of the most misunderstood. This seems like us reverting back to form. </p>
<p>Though I do wish they'd have picked a more entertaining game to play; football is so rules-heavy that it always feels more like watching a courtroom drama than a sport whenever I'm unable to avoid watching a game.</p>

Bigger, faster, stronger bodies = more risk. Simply put, youth football  High School Football  College  NFL. The speed and violence increase as you go up, and the increases are not linear. </p>
<p>I think time has tempered some of the initial panic caused by observing the (admittedly scary) outcomes for some long-time NFL players (of different eras with different rules and different equipment), and many have come to the conclusion that youth and high school football just don't pose the same sort of risks, or risks that outweigh the benefits.</p>

Twitter/X should go back to limiting posts to 140 characters, because you could probably sum up this person's thoughts in that many. Democrats bad, rule by deception, Republicans rule by persuasion. Conspiracy theories true. Internet good.</p>

Martin Gurri has written similarly on this topic.</p>
</blockquote><p>I think where he goes wrong is where he gets to this point where he's like "because you're speaking on the internet, you can't really deceive people", which is laughably wrong. It's like he's never heard of confirmation bias, or echo chambers.  People on the internet will randomly make things up, and other people will believe them, just because it confirms their priors. Being on the internet does not, in any way, guarentees that anything you see on it is true. It actually reminds me of a conversation I had 30 years ago, with the teenage brother of someone I knew in high school. He had found a bunch of information on the internet arguing that the CIA created AIDS to kill black people in Africa, and he was like "it must be true, <i>I found it on the internet</i>" . </p>
<p>Of course we all know now that the internet is the home of every insane conspiracy theory you can imagine. And it hasn't changed at all! And this guy is operating on the level of early-internet high-school student that just discovered it. </p>
<p>Fact check all you want. People will believe whatever they want to believe. They will make up the evidence if they have to. </p>

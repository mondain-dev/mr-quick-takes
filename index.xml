Many emissions reductions or removals will require significant R&amp;D and infrastructure— these can’t be done overnight even if there was the political will for it. So creating some incentives for to tackle the high-lying fruit today may still make some sense.</p>

I'm not convinced that this debate has not devolved into a mud slinging debacle between anti-nuke Labor activists and Liberal NukeBros but Aidan Morrison certainly seems to be focused on the real-world economic and engineering trade-offs involved. I was surprised to learn that the rooftop solar feed-in tariffs have stalled the growth of grid-scale solar. State Capacity Libertarians like Tyler need to reconcile their support for nuclear with the significant state financial support that seems to be a prerequisite for high-CapEx/long-life mega projects like nuclear and hydroelectric generation, ditto greenfield transmission. </p>
<p>I hope Crikey listens or (YouTube) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RRJfVd-oAB4" rel="nofollow ugc">watches</a> the conversation. I'm not sure that the price advantage of renewables is as stark as his renewables+coal loving mates believe. Accurately modelling the future integrated electrical system (i.e. the grid) is non-trivial, IMO, and we should work on building shared models that all stakeholders can use to promote their positions. YMMV. </p>
<p>BTW, I think the Ontario IESO models are facile. I'm hoping that the Aussies and/or Yanks set an example that Ontario's planners can follow.</p>

It was good because it gave us another peek from professionals that are  tasked with providing reliable power to consumers. </p>
<p>This was a coalition of engineers working at providers for mid-atlantic region. They expect demand to increase 40% in the next 15 years. That's 2.3% YoY. </p>
<p>What is interesting is another group of engineers focused on the midwest grids see a lot of coal retiring. But for every MW of coal that retires, you don't just replace it with a MW of solar. Instead 1 MW of coal must be replaced with 4.2 MW of wind, or a staggering 21.4 MW of fixed solar.</p>
<p>So, when we see people saying "Oh, look the levelized cost of solar is better than coal!" and I reply "Yes, but that ignores the intermittency aspect. Solar must be substantially overbuilt to deliver the same utility as coal. That means you need a solar farm, backed by batteries, backed by gas peaking plants"</p>
<p>We now know that you need 21MW of solar to replace 1 MW of coal. And at those numbers, the math doesn't work. </p>
<p>I often wonder why people that believe solar is cheaper than coal wonder why anyone is still building coal. In the US they might argue it's because of "big coal." But China doesn't have those concerns. And they are building coal plants left and right. Solar yes. But mostly coal. And why? Because the math on solar doesn't work. And if you need 21MW of solar to replace a MW of coal, suddenly it should be clear to all.</p>
</blockquote><p>Perish the very thought.</p>
<p>However, Germany is currently burning less coal for electricity generation than before nuclear power was available for electricity generation. Checking the ever useful numbers at www energy-charts info, in July 2014 Germany was using coal to generate 30GW of electricity. Same week in 2024, coal is used to generate about 8GW. </p>
<p>Yet somehow, Germany did not actually install 400GW of solar capacity. In part, of course, because anyone able to run a stable grid with higher reliability than America's uses a mix of generation sources. The real numbers for Germany seem to be a total installed capacity amounting to 81.8 gigawatts at the end of 2023.</p>
<p>Doubt is not the right term concerning your numbers, but that is the way to go with whatever you present as reality. Not that anyone ever expects you to check the information you so easily repeat here.</p>
<p>Sometimes, one gets the feeling that even TC is a bit embarrassed, like the fate of that thread on Trump's lying.</p>

The reason it's so busy in the first place was because it was approximately near the great circle route that most airplanes took between east Asia and the US, and was midway through. Planes didn't have as much range back then (and ETOPS hadn't been introduced), so they had to stop in Anchorage to refuel. Cargo planes sacrifice range for cargo tonnage, so they still to this day stop in Anchorage to refuel when flying between North America and east Asia.</p>
<p>However, they do NOT stop in Anchorage when flying between east Asia and Europe. That's the complete wrong direction. For example, flying from Shanghai to London is ~9300km directly. Stopping in Anchorage first adds another 5000km to the route (7000km from Shanghai to Anchorage, 7200km from Anchorage to London). As far as I can tell, most China-Europe air freight flies direct.</p>
<p>If the argument is "Anchorage is near the Bering Strait so it will see a lot of cargo pass through it," that seems to me silly. Cargo vessels can stay at sea for weeks at a time, even the largest ones, so they wouldn't need to come into port in Anchorage to resupply like cargo planes do. They would just carry on to China or Korea or wherever. That being said, the proximity to all that shipping makes it an obvious location for a major US naval presence.</p>

<p>This is highly unlikely. It's not even in the Top 50 in the world in shipping ports:</p>
<p>https://www.worldshipping.org/top-50-ports</p>
<p>And in fact, shipping ports have things either going out, coming in, or some of both. As was originally pointed out, cargo ships don't generally stop at ports to refuel (they refuel while they're loading or unloading cargo). </p>
<p>And there is nothing nearby Anchorage to haul goods from or to.</p>
<p>Not a good grade for "Student" on this one. ;-)</p>

<p>Yes, femcels exist too. Though they don't get the press that incels do. It's just as sad though. It will inevitably lead to a lonely life and regret in the long run. Sure a chatbot will always say what you want to hear, but that's not healthy. A large part of life is having a partner to share life with. You aren't sharing life with a chatbot. It's no different than living your life in books or TV instead of making human connections.</p>

"[T]o bring people closer to God." Years ago in my church, the  Episcopal Church, and in the Roman Catholic Church, the reformists began a redesign of the interior of the building, moving the altar from the front wall out close to the congregation, the idea being to bring the people closer to God. But does it? </p>
<p>The area around the altar and cross is called the "sanctuary". I suppose the sanctuary was removed from the people when it was at the wall, but when the "sanctuary" was moved out among the people, the "sanctuary" became more like the cashier at Walmart than the sacred place inhabited by God. When the sanctuary was separated, it was a mystical place: one could feel the presence of God in this special, separate space, that only a few could enter. I was an acolyte, so I was allowed in this sacred space, and I felt it. I still do in the churches with the traditional design. I've argued with young priests about this who only know the new design. but when I say that the new design has diminished the sacred place of the sanctuary, as anybody can and does wander around the altar like the cashier at Walmart. Does it matter? For those who have a "personal relationship" with God, I suppose not. Pray tell.</p>

<p>Yes, femcels exist too. Though they don't get the press that incels do. It's just as sad though. It will inevitably lead to a lonely life and regret in the long run. Sure a chatbot will always say what you want to hear, but that's not healthy. A large part of life is having a partner to share life with. You aren't sharing life with a chatbot. It's no different than living your life in books or TV instead of making human connections.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote><p>A large part of life is having a <b>partner</b> to share life with.</p></blockquote>
<p>"Partner" is the tricky part. Women's shelters are testimonies to the lie that marriage always implies partnership. Likewise, Charles Murray'a hypothetical Fishtown is filled with women in the bottom quintile of the socioeconomic spectrum that would likely make terrible partners for an ideal blue collar man with no character flaws. YMMV.</p>
<p>This is why atheists like Tyler and I are not against Faith in Fishtown, even if it comes across as hypocritical. 12 Steps for Thee but not for Me. Prison chaplains FTW.</p>

</blockquote><p>Yes, we can burn the US flag, we can burn a cross with jesus on it. We can sexualize Jesus. The other side puts their iconography on a crosswalk. And then dares anyone to drive atop it without reverence. What would happen if you burned a pride flag? If you drew a picture of mohammed and burned that? Or drew a picture of mohammed having gay sex? Jail. That's what.</p>
<p>The ultimate eff-you is forcing one side to accept the desecration of their iconography, while putting them in jail if they don't celebrate yours. </p>
<p>Kids in WA state are looking at up to 10 years for peeling out on their scooters on a pride crosswalk.</p>

</blockquote><p>I think Tyler expects intellectual and media elites (overwhelmingly on the left) to do better and not spread misinformation or embrace outright conspiracies like the bizarre claim that Trump wasn't really shot at. For better or worse he holds them to a higher standard than the Right who tend to downplay or reject intellectualism and the academy already. In general I agree, comes out of CNN, ABC, MSNBC, NPR, Slate, NY Times, The Atlantic, and universities etc is much more important than low level Republican operatives try and push on their own voters.</p>

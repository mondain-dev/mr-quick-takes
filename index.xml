Bargains: “Connecticut’s only home with an FAA-approved private paved airstrip is selling for $2.9 million.”'</p>
<p>This brings up the question of what does a private airstrip need to do to be approved by the FAA.  (And what flight operations can it carry out if it lacks FAA approval?  Presumably I can fly a drone from my driveway, but carrying paying passengers would entail a much higher level of regulatory scrutiny.  But what about non-paying passengers that I give a ride to on my Cessna?)</p>
<p>The FAA website has the answers, but it'd be too exhausting to hunt down the answer:<br />
https://www.faa.gov/airports/airport_safety/part139_cert</p>
<p>One summer I worked as a lowly office assistant for a regional FAA office, mainly doing filing and routine typing of forms.  That office had about ten engineers who  were always out in the field somewhere, and would return with a folder of stuff that I'd file away, usually the  folder was about a VASI or RIL at a small general aviation airport.</p>
<p>My job was so lowly that I didn't need to know what a VASI or a RIL is so I didn't ask.  Years and years later it occurred to me to wonder and I saw that these are Vertical Approach Slope Indicators, and Runway Indicator Lights.  The FAA engineers were designing where to put the VASI and RIL devices at those airports.</p>
<p>From the photos, it appears that this Connecticut airstrip lacks those.  So presumably that airstrip cannot be used in certain kinds of weather (or darkness), or by certain kinds of planes, or by planes doing certain kinds of business (flying paid passengers).  That's my guess anyway.</p>
<p>I don't even see a wind sock in the photos?</p>

Does coddling the “unhoused” have to take precedence over the rest of us citizens and our ability to enjoy public restrooms, parks, libraries, and sidewalks? Just round them all up and take them to facilities to treat drug and mental health problems that are located outside of these expensive cities and in cheaper areas where they can be run more cost-effectively. And leave the expensive city streets to responsible citizens who don’t use public restrooms to shoot up drugs or get blowjobs from trans hookers and just want to relieve their full bladders, aim inside the rim, flush afterwards and wash their hands before going on their merry way.</p>

Way down here near my new home there are two "air ranches": each a residential development for very large homes on large lots (small ranches) with a long airstrip (for large jets) and a hangar in the back yard. John Travolta lives in one of the air ranches. At last count, he has seven jets including a Bombardier Challenger 601, Boeing 727, Eclipse 500, Dassault Falcon 900, and three Gulfstream jets. No, he can't fly all of them at once. There is no commercial air service in the immediate area partly because the wealthy people who live in the area, and there are many of them, don't fly commercial. These folks don't horse around.</p>

There are at least two of them in my area. They are probably less common in CT. I'm not sure how much being 30 minutes by air from NYC is useful. Bristol is about a 2 hour drive, and that gets you into Manhattan. Odds are you'd have to fly into Teterboro or some place like that, an hour out of the city.</p>

<p>I do not think that unintelligent life can randomly spread at interstellar scale. Intelligent and technologically advanced life is likely to spread purposefully. At high enough level of technological advancement, the only truly scarce resource in energy. So advanced life is likely to seek massive energy sources - black holes, neutron stars etc. Neither our star system not neighboring star systems have anything of value to advanced civilizations. And we do not have ability to see what is going on farther that that. We do not even know how many planets are there in the nearest star system.</p>
<p>To me the whole Fermi paradox seems to have a simple resolution. We are not advanced enough to see what is going on around us. Asking "Where is everybody" is like having a bunch of ants who explored 30-meter radius around their anthill and believe they are the only advanced species in their world because they have not found anything except plants and worms.</p>
<p>"...then we should be colonized by previous generations of intelligence. But we haven’t ...". </p>
<p>You mean "we have not been wiped out". Which is why we can think these thoughts right now.</p>

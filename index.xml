Zachary Mazlish on median wages under Biden by Heedless]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Reply to M:</p><blockquote><p>Here's something I still find puzzling:</p>
<p>1) US real GDP per person has supposedly increased about 10% since 2019.</p>
<p>This is driven not only by increases in investment, exports, but real actual individual consumption per head. (And supposedly this is "the envy of the world").</p>
<p>2) US real income per person, deflated by the private consumption deflator, is supposedly are down on 2019.</p>
<p>3) US wealth per head is not decreasing rapidly. US private debt per head is not increasing rapidly per person.</p>
<p>So what funds the increases in real consumption? Is this all down to asset price appreciation and then selling assets to pay for consumption? Is there some inconsistency here where the deflator for private consumption in GDP and for wages have diverged a lot?</p>
</blockquote><p>Didn't the  American government borrow $12 trillion over the course of last four years?</p>
<p>That's more than $12,000 per person per year.  No need to increase your personal debt if the government is borrowing 20% of the median national salary every year on your behalf.</p>

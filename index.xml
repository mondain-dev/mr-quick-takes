<p>&gt; Sponsors of the law say its purpose — prohibiting access to TikTok if it’s not sold to an American entity — is to sever the short-video app’s links to China’s Communist Party. The reality is that the American government will likely end up banning TikTok, turning it off for 170 million American users.</p>
<p>And that should be victory for everyone saying that TikTok and the CCP are one and the same.</p>
<p>Frankly I am sick and tired of all these so-called experts who do not know or refuse to play by tit-for-tat. Every single American company operating in China is a JV or complies with China's data and censorship laws. Can't play by our rules, then GTFO, the CCP says. Well I cannot think of a more reasonable rule than a news platform that broadcasts to half of Americans cannot be owned by the CCP.</p>
</blockquote><p>"Every single American company operating in China is a JV ..."</p>
<p>Sounds like the opposite of truth: "A large majority of new foreign investments in China are WFOEs [=wholly foreign owned enterprises], rather than JVs. As Chinese legal entities, WFOEs experience greater independence than ROs, are allowed exclusive control over carrying out business activities while abiding by Chinese law and are granted intellectual and technological rights." (https://www.export.gov/apex/article2?id=China-Establishing-an-Office)</p>
<p>"WFOE refers to a limited liability company that is 100% invested, owned by foreign investors, and independently operated. Almost 60% of foreign-owned companies are WFOEs, making it the most adopted business type. Famous multinational companies such as Apple, Amazon, Oracle, and General Electric are all examples of WFOEs." (https://arc-group.com/china-company-setup/)</p>

</blockquote><p>I should mention H5N1 bird flu which is infecting dairy cows (don't drink raw milk!) across America and alarming public health officials. One article I read last week described pig farms as a Petri dish for the virus, and that we are in real trouble if the virus spreads to pigs. I don't care for pork myself. Worms, bird flu, I recommend going kosher.</p>

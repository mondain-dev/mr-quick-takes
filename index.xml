<p>"<i>Milei’s first 100 days came and went without any legislative achievements. An omnibus bill that would have given him sweeping executive powers and included measures ranging from the privatization of state entities to penalties for protesters stalled in committee. “If they expected that the President would change the way he is, that’s never going to happen,” Manuel Adorni, his exhausted-looking spokesman, told me in his small office in the Casa Rosada, sipping maté. Earlier in the day, Adorni had spent his press briefing shooting down questions from reporters about his boss’s mental health, spurred by Milei’s repeated reference to having five dogs, even though one is known to have died years ago. (“If the President says there are five dogs, there are five dogs, and that’s the end of it.”)</i>"</p>
<p>(The global zenith of forgetful leaders?)</p>
<p>Not yet anyway.</p>

<p><i><a href="https://www.economicsobservatory.com/what-economic-challenges-does-argentina-face-today" rel="nofollow ugc">Economics Observatory - Argentina under a new government: what are the big economic challenges?</a> (8th May 2024)</i></p>
<p>The context: "<i>Over the last decade, the country has witnessed a 10.4% drop in per capita income, and its history of sovereign defaults and restructurings has led to prohibitively high interest rates in international credit markets.</i>"</p>
<p>The source of the Milei fiscal surplus: "<i>Spending cuts have been deep and across the board, slashing real primary expenditures by 35% compared with last year.</p>
<p>On the one hand, non-discretionary spending is being adjusted below the inflation rate. For example, pensions decreased by 36% year-over-year and contributed the <b>lion’s share</b> of the overall fiscal adjustment, amounting to 43% of the total. On the other hand, the cuts include a significant nominal reduction in discretionary spending. <b>Capital spending</b> and transfers to provinces contributed 32% of the overall fiscal adjustment. Economic subsidies, particularly for energy firms, have been reduced at the expense of <b>accumulating arrears with utility companies</b>."</i></p>
<p>Mainly cutting pensions and capital expenditures on infrastructure. Still I guess you're only losing 16% of the vote base immediately (over 65s), and the airports won't fall down immediately.<br />
(Hence E. Barandiaran's comment on Milei largely giving up, electorally I guess, on the old in favour of leaning into the young).<br />
Relatively little day-to-day real terms cuts on public sector wages per worker, so far, by the looks of it.<br />
Falls in Economic Activity: "<i>Economic activity fell by <b>3.3% year-over-year per month in December, January and February</b>. Private estimates also suggest a <b>decline in March</b>.</i><i>"<br />
Separately an estimate for how much economic activity has fallen Year-on-Year in March (via a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/23/javier-milei-buenos-aires-argentina" rel="nofollow ugc">Guardian</a> article otherwise focused on Milei's rock frontman antics): "</i><i>Hours before Milei picked up the mic, the government’s statistics bureau announced that economic activity had fallen by a <b>whopping 8.4% in March</b> compared with the previous year."</i><br />
...</p>
<p>The Milei recession will be truly deep, deep, deep (perhaps Argentina will be &lt;20% down on per capita income from 15 years ago?), and it will fall predominantly on pensioners and infrastructure. But is there actually another alternative, or is chickens coming to roost?</p>

Surreal to see this in the NYT. For anyone who was in NYC during COVID, one of the worst things that happened was seeing Washington Square Park turned into an open air weed bazaar with tables lined up every 5 feet advertising “WEED”. Around that time, I also saw someone literally just squat and defecate in the middle of the park too while NYPD seemingly just ignored it.</p>
<p>A big change in my beliefs during that time was that when things decay, the worst effect and biggest danger is often on the morals of the median person. I never saw “non homeless” people jump the turnstiles, but during COVID even well-paid people would see random people jump the turnstiles and NYPD do nothing, and then they ask “well what the hell did I just pay for?” which is a dangerous feedback loop that wrecks civilization over time.</p>

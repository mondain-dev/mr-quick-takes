<p>Silicon Valley bit-wranglers have total dependence on Asian atom-wranglers. The folks at Apple who design chips and iPhones need Taiwanese foundries and Chinese factories to actually make them physical.</p>
<p>Evolving a manufacturing ecosystem onshore is no trivial or quick task. Throwing money at it won't do the trick, all the more so if that CHIPS funding is tied to a million wishful sociopolitical and pork-barrel agendas. The effort needs decades and is already off on the wrong foot.</p>
<p>Above all you need to manufacture cheaply on a massive scale, with scant regard for environmental impact externalities. The Pentagon only knows how to make ridiculously expensive stuff. With extreme asymmetries of expense, you end up losing a war of cost attrition. Arguably that's what happened in Afghanistan. It also explains the failure in the Red Sea: you can't afford to shoot down every single dirt-cheap drone with a million-dollar missile.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, innovation is exemplified by the glide bomb: a hybrid of Chinese-tech-enabled "glide" guidance smarts and massive Russian capacity to build and stockpile stuff that goes boom. I suspect this book is all about merely designing the first kind of thing, and not actually making both at scale and on budget.</p>

<p>Anyone want to argue that Elon Musks is not the most influential person in the world right now?</p>
<p>He didnâ€™t make the lists.  His Twitter purchase completely changed the Overton window in the U.S., he revolutionized our rocket industry, launched a new telecom company, and sped up electric cars by probably a decade maybe more.  </p>
<p>I would argue that Trump is not yet the most influential New Yorker of all time yet.  Perhaps he wins the next election and does something but his only long term accomplishment as of now is flipping the SC.</p>
<p>I believe Arianna Grande was for Miami.  Ken Griffin tops that.  Grande has zero effects on world events.</p>

</blockquote><p>Also, Seattle area: no Bill Gates???  Henrdix was a great musician.  But in terms of world influence, Gates, hand down.  </p>
<p>It does not seem to include business people</p>

Economists have been writing about it for ages. In traditional prediction markets, the bet is made by lending money, contracting for future delivery or buying a share of an enterprise. </p>
<p>What is called a prediction market here is basically old fashioned book making. One is betting on being correct in one's prediction, not in simply getting one's money back with interest, a supply of some commodity at a fixed price or a share of a more valuable enterprise.</p>
<p>People bet on predictions all the time. You can bet on horse races, elections, football games, and probably anything else. This appeals to gamblers, but gamblers want to get their rush in a timely manner. It only works when one is betting maybe a few weeks out, but ideally less.</p>

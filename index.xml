<p>Potatoes were huge for Europe, but less so for China.  I suppose they were fine with the rice and wheat they were already growing, whereas potatoes could produce unprecedented food yields for places such as Ireland.  (I did observe that fried potatoes were a very popular street food in ChongQing.   Not something that we normally associate with Sichuan cuisine -- but these fried potatoes had red chiles mixed in.)</p>
<p>Maize may've done something similar for sub-Saharan Africa, it seemed to be widespread not just in cities but in the hinterlands too:</p>
<p>"Maize accounts for 30−50% of low-income household expenditures in Africa. Over 30% of the caloric intake of people in sub‐Saharan Africa comes from maize."<br />
https://www.iita.org/cropsnew/maize/</p>
<p>Chocolate/cocoa is more of a luxury product than a staple, it's also widespread but though it's certainly available in places such as Africa and China it's not as commonly seen as maize, potatoes, etc.</p>
<p>But though those New World foods revolutionized cuisine and nutrition worldwide, the continents that were really revolutionized were the Americas, where the Europeans brought beef, pork, wheat, onions, rice, bananas (from Africa, but via the colonizers), etc. etc.  Interestingly the Incas had chickens -- that had to have been brought by Polynesians.</p>

Clark, and so on, to collect a detailed catalogue of predilections for specific and less specific dates in the future. Everyone should try to get their hands on this book, and re-read it every five years or so, as I do. It’s a great corrective to the bad habit of couching our biases and opinion in the form of predictions. So many of these expert opinions are spectacularly wrong, and some are so startlingly right (up to a point), that it is also immensely entertaining. (Nobel-winner Friedman, by the way, is asked to predict future winners of the Nobel in Economics. His guesses in 1981 were George Stiegler, Gary Becker, Martin Feldstein, Robert Lucas and Franco Modigliani. That’s two correct, if I’m not mistaken.)</p>

<p>I don't think that's necessarily wrong, although the point that gives me pause is whether sprawling gives rise to more pollution.</p>
<p>As per that Neal Stephenson bit from Snow Crash: </p>
<p><i>"All these beefy Caucasians with guns! Get enough of them together, looking for the America they always believed they'd grow up in, and they glom together like overcooked rice, form integral, starchy little units. With their power tools, portable generators, weapons, four-wheel-drive vehicles, and personal computers, they are like beavers hyped up on crystal meth, manic engineers without a blueprint, chewing through the wilderness, building things and abandoning them, altering the flow of mighty rivers and then moving on because the place ain't what it used to be. </p>
<p>The byproduct of the lifestyle is polluted rivers, greenhouse effect, spouse abuse, televangelists, and serial killers. But as long as you have that four-wheel-drive vehicle and can keep driving north, you can sustain it, keep moving just quickly enough to stay one step ahead of your own waste stream. In twenty years, ten million white people will converge on the north pole and park their bagos there. The low-grade waste heat of their thermodynamically intense lifestyle will turn the crystalline icescape pliable and treacherous. It will melt a hole through the polar icecap, and all that metal will sink to the bottom, sucking the biomass down with it."</i></p>

<p>The article focuses on a 15 square block portion of the downtown office district that does sound like it's really struggling: a 44 story office tower sold for a pittance ($4 million) in 2022, an old 21 story office building is vacant with windows boarded up, a parking garage across the street from that building is condemned, 2/3 of storefronts in that area are vacant.</p>
<p>The same article notes that other nearby areas are doing better, with a couple of those thriving: an area just west that's had a lot of residential redevelopment, and an area of restaurants/bars near the Cardinals' baseball stadium.</p>

Then again, I actually sort of like doing chores. 8 years of Catholic school and I still can't sit still, so I may as well do something productive. Plus, if I'm doing chores I can let my mind wander--washing dishes does not require much mental effort--without being interrupted--because anyone who interrupts will get roped into helping. </p>
<p>I do wonder how much bias is in this, though. Where do you fit gardening, or lawn care, into this equation? A good father will teach his kids how to care for a house, and a lot of men use these things for exercise, but they're also chores necessary for the function of many households. Lots of places for the authors to be factually correct but not truthful. </p>
<p>7: I saw this. I wonder how much it replicates. I know the Great Apes engage in systematic warfare, have regional dialects, and a few other traits that used to be considered purely human. It's going to be increasingly difficult to draw a line between "animal" and "human". (I'm fine using a paraphyletic group in this case; it's a useful distinction that we all understand, and whether something's paraphyletic or not has enough of a temporal component that most paleontologists become comfortable with them. Polyphyletic groupings are still not real, which is why fish and trees don't, phylogenetically speaking, exist.)</p>

If N=4 is good enough, surely N=1 is also maybe good enough if the disease is a "swift death sentence". I mean, why have an FDA process at all for drugs for diseases that are a "swift death sentence"?</p>
<p>How absurd it is to deny any experimental drug to a patient with a death sentence for a disease. If pain is a concern, why not have voluntary human trails? </p>
<p>I appreciate Eli Dourado's suggestion for that FDA reform but seems like applying an efficient solution to an artificial problem. Just scrap the FDA process altogether for diseases of this sort.</p>

<p>Disputes about subsidies and incentives:</p>
<p>"<i>In fast-growing South Carolina, lawmakers have pointed to data centers as a major factor in rising electricity demand.</p>
<p>As part of a broader energy bill, the legislature considered a measure that would prevent data centers from receiving discounted power rates.</p>
<p>Republican state Rep. Jay West said inducements such as reduced power rates are appropriate for major, transformational endeavors. He pointed to the BMW factory in Spartanburg, which employs 11,000 people, draws in major suppliers and pumps millions into the state economy.</p>
<p>While data centers boost local property taxes receipts, they don't do much for the state, he said, and shouldn't receive preferential rates. And they are being built faster than new energy generation can be added.</p>
<p>"I do not speak for my caucus or the [legislative] body in saying this," he said, "but I don't think South Carolina can handle more data centers."</p>
<p>The House provision on data center utility rates was quickly struck in a Senate committee, the South Carolina Daily Gazette reported.</p>
<p>Lynn Teague, vice president of the League of Women Voters of South Carolina, said that change was made with no public discussion.</p>
<p>Teague, who lobbies the legislature, said South Carolinians, including more than 700,000 people living in poverty, shouldn't have to pick up the tab for tax or utility breaks for major data center firms.</p>
<p>"We have companies like Google with over $300 billion in revenues a year wanting these folks to <b>subsidize their profit margin at the same time that they're putting intense pressure on not just our energy, but our water</b>," she said.</p>
<p>Lawmakers saw data centers as a possible successor to South Carolina's declining textile industry when they approved the data center incentives in 2012, The State reported at the time. One Republican bill sponsor, then-state Rep. Phyllis Henderson, also cited North Carolina's success with data center incentives, saying South Carolina was "just losing projects right and left to them."</p>
<p>But on the Senate floor earlier this month, Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, a Republican, described data centers as "<b>electricity hogs that aren't really providing a whole lot of jobs</b>.""</i></p>

<p>Don't get me wrong.  Barriers to adding nuclear are often opaque and administrative (NRC and NEPA).  The delay tactics of anti-nuke advocates are especially toxic against high capital cost nuke plants.  They know this, especially with their safety insanity.  </p>
<p>Safety systems with 99% + dozens of repeating 9's after the decimal point are never enough.  There's always room for more, costs be damned.</p>
<p>Anyway, break out the popcorn for the fight between Enviro Loons and the Tech Titans over power generation.</p>

Interesting.  It's worth noting that the WSJ also just had an article on Russia's economy and they highlighted the really high inflation.  Regardless, with so many bad predictions on so many aspects of the war in Ukraine, who is making real adjustments based on their mistakes?  It seems like everyone, from every perspective, just wants to double or triple down on bad predictions.  (Of course, this doesn't seem to just impact this war, but on all sorts of predictions in so many fields.)  It feels like the standard response is, "It is true, we thought our ideas would work better, but it just means we need to do our ideas much more vehemently than we originally supposed."  Is there anyone saying, from any perspective, at least with this war, "I was wrong and we really need to re-think this entirely"?  Also, everyone seems to think they know entirely what is in Putin's wicked heart.  Forever wars seem to be really bad.  I think there is more room for negotiation than the warmongers believe, but then, maybe I'm wrong too.</p>

</blockquote><p>Good comment, better than the one that I was about to make, namely about their line:</p>
<p>"Our central claim is that AI x-risk forecasts are far too unreliable to be useful for policy, and in fact highly misleading."</p>
<p>Well duh, and that's also why so much of the EA stuff went off the rails years ago:  people trying to estimate probabilities that we lack sufficient information about.</p>
<p>But your comment is much better:  we live in a world of high uncertainty, so how do we make decisions about momentous but uncertain events?  We prepare for possibilities not probabilities, knowing that we can't afford to fully prepare for them.  We build to be anti-fragile when feasible.  Etc.</p>

I'm not convinced that this debate has not devolved into a mud slinging debacle between anti-nuke Labor activists and Liberal NukeBros but Aidan Morrison certainly seems to be focused on the real-world economic and engineering trade-offs involved. I was surprised to learn that the rooftop solar feed-in tariffs have stalled the growth of grid-scale solar. State Capacity Libertarians like Tyler need to reconcile their support for nuclear with the significant state financial support that seems to be a prerequisite for high-CapEx/long-life mega projects like nuclear and hydroelectric generation, ditto greenfield transmission. </p>
<p>I hope Crikey listens or (YouTube) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RRJfVd-oAB4" rel="nofollow ugc">watches</a> the conversation. I'm not sure that the price advantage of renewables is as stark as his renewables+coal loving mates believe. Accurately modelling the future integrated electrical system (i.e. the grid) is non-trivial, IMO, and we should work on building shared models that all stakeholders can use to promote their positions. YMMV. </p>
<p>BTW, I think the Ontario IESO models are facile. I'm hoping that the Aussies and/or Yanks set an example that Ontario's planners can follow.</p>

It was good because it gave us another peek from professionals that are  tasked with providing reliable power to consumers. </p>
<p>This was a coalition of engineers working at providers for mid-atlantic region. They expect demand to increase 40% in the next 15 years. That's 2.3% YoY. </p>
<p>What is interesting is another group of engineers focused on the midwest grids see a lot of coal retiring. But for every MW of coal that retires, you don't just replace it with a MW of solar. Instead 1 MW of coal must be replaced with 4.2 MW of wind, or a staggering 21.4 MW of fixed solar.</p>
<p>So, when we see people saying "Oh, look the levelized cost of solar is better than coal!" and I reply "Yes, but that ignores the intermittency aspect. Solar must be substantially overbuilt to deliver the same utility as coal. That means you need a solar farm, backed by batteries, backed by gas peaking plants"</p>
<p>We now know that you need 21MW of solar to replace 1 MW of coal. And at those numbers, the math doesn't work. </p>
<p>I often wonder why people that believe solar is cheaper than coal wonder why anyone is still building coal. In the US they might argue it's because of "big coal." But China doesn't have those concerns. And they are building coal plants left and right. Solar yes. But mostly coal. And why? Because the math on solar doesn't work. And if you need 21MW of solar to replace a MW of coal, suddenly it should be clear to all.</p>
</blockquote><p>Perish the very thought.</p>
<p>However, Germany is currently burning less coal for electricity generation than before nuclear power was available for electricity generation. Checking the ever useful numbers at www energy-charts info, in July 2014 Germany was using coal to generate 30GW of electricity. Same week in 2024, coal is used to generate about 8GW. </p>
<p>Yet somehow, Germany did not actually install 400GW of solar capacity. In part, of course, because anyone able to run a stable grid with higher reliability than America's uses a mix of generation sources. The real numbers for Germany seem to be a total installed capacity amounting to 81.8 gigawatts at the end of 2023.</p>
<p>Doubt is not the right term concerning your numbers, but that is the way to go with whatever you present as reality. Not that anyone ever expects you to check the information you so easily repeat here.</p>
<p>Sometimes, one gets the feeling that even TC is a bit embarrassed, like the fate of that thread on Trump's lying.</p>

The reason it's so busy in the first place was because it was approximately near the great circle route that most airplanes took between east Asia and the US, and was midway through. Planes didn't have as much range back then (and ETOPS hadn't been introduced), so they had to stop in Anchorage to refuel. Cargo planes sacrifice range for cargo tonnage, so they still to this day stop in Anchorage to refuel when flying between North America and east Asia.</p>
<p>However, they do NOT stop in Anchorage when flying between east Asia and Europe. That's the complete wrong direction. For example, flying from Shanghai to London is ~9300km directly. Stopping in Anchorage first adds another 5000km to the route (7000km from Shanghai to Anchorage, 7200km from Anchorage to London). As far as I can tell, most China-Europe air freight flies direct.</p>
<p>If the argument is "Anchorage is near the Bering Strait so it will see a lot of cargo pass through it," that seems to me silly. Cargo vessels can stay at sea for weeks at a time, even the largest ones, so they wouldn't need to come into port in Anchorage to resupply like cargo planes do. They would just carry on to China or Korea or wherever. That being said, the proximity to all that shipping makes it an obvious location for a major US naval presence.</p>

<p>This is highly unlikely. It's not even in the Top 50 in the world in shipping ports:</p>
<p>https://www.worldshipping.org/top-50-ports</p>
<p>And in fact, shipping ports have things either going out, coming in, or some of both. As was originally pointed out, cargo ships don't generally stop at ports to refuel (they refuel while they're loading or unloading cargo). </p>
<p>And there is nothing nearby Anchorage to haul goods from or to.</p>
<p>Not a good grade for "Student" on this one. ;-)</p>

Hokkaido (Sapporo) would make much more sense. In any case I can see the Kurils dispute heating up as they could become a pirate haven if Russian state penetration remains as nonexistent there as it is.</p>
<p>But as Tyler likes to say, don't underestimate the elasticity of supply. With such large undeveloped stretches of coastline suddenly becoming habitable it would almost be easier to push for a charter city/port on the Arctic coast. An American version of Svalbard (On St. Lawrence Island?) would be a fascinating thing to behold.</p>

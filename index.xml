<p>Laminated dough made with good butter freezes surprisingly well. </p>
<p>And the French (unsurprisingly) have been at the forefront of scaling quality food in a number of ways for over half a century. Sous-vide storage and cooking arose there in the 60s for banquet service. Sophisticated hot-holding devices that combine steam and dry heat to preserve quality were invented there and are now used internationally, including at many famous Texas BBQ spots. And, of course, the robot-coupe remains the premier food processor in the world to this day. They also happily employ micro-wave ovens. </p>
<p>It's a beautiful and complex world - almost always better to appreciate in its whole than via the points scored with a simplistic attempted dunk.</p>

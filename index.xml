<p>I think it's important to understand that if avian flu does become transmissible between humans, it will have different features than COVID. And lessons learned from COVID may or may not apply.</p>
<p>A notable feature of COVID is that the older your age, the higher your risk of death. The very young - children - were spared. This is not how, say, the Spanish Flu worked. There, healthy young people with good immune systems died because of cytokine storms. And most diseases throughout history definitely did not spare the very young. We are not prepared emotionally for a pandemic that kills kids. </p>
<p>I do worry that if this thing spreads to people, we'll treat it like COVID when in fact it would likely follow different rules.</p>

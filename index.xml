</blockquote><p>Excellent, excellent comment. People used to laugh at the religious right back in the 80's when they bemoaned the weakening of the moral fabric of society, but they were absolutely right. All of the liberal Enlightenment values that ever American takes for granted can only exist in a polity that's composed of fundamentally decent high-IQ people. That's the unappreciated social infrastructure that makes our polyglot culture possible and we have let it completely decay. We have torched the commons of collective American identity and have passed the tipping point. The fuse on the demographic bomb has been lit and there's no going back. America is in inexorable Idiocratic decline and in 40 years we'll be a richer version of Argentina. Oh well, it was nice while it lasted.</p>

</blockquote><p>In theory, Marxism doesn’t make economic sense. In practice, it’s much worse.</p>

Hasbro has proven that their respect for the reserve list is so strong, the availability of old cards makes lost bitcoin look  like a small part of the supply. A large strategic supply of dual lands would be easier to defend from hackers than bitcoin too, so there's no reason to look elsewhere.</p>

They can make decisions to screw working class whites, like imposing environmental constraints that destroy manufacturing, while tossing some DEI bones to blacks. Nobody cares about unemployed or underemployed working class white men. They can go pound sand or die via fentanyl - deaths of despair. It's amazing we don't see more mass shootings. I guess white working class men are more that happy to go quietly into that good night.</p>
<p>That could change but I don't think it will. Working class white men have been well trained to blame themselves for things beyond their control.</p>

</blockquote><p>So your solution is a DEI program for losers? So they can buy more cannabinoids? </p>
<p>No one wants to hire people with poor social skills.</p>

</blockquote><p>Ending the war and getting the hell out of Ukraine would be great for the average Russian.  Unfortunately, the super-geniuses who got Russia into this situation don't think it would be good for them and are trying to put it off as long as possible - no matter the cost in other people's lives.</p>

</blockquote><p>Really, a fitting avatar for the trend of spending down long-term institutional credibility for short-term partisan ends over the past ~25 years.</p>

</blockquote><p>Interestingly, this exact critique of Krugman being "smart and intelligent but often a dishonest partisan hack of the center-left/left" also applies to Matt Yglesias. A few examples from a long and illustrious career of rank dishonesty and hackery, but Tyler seems to think he is an honest interlocutor (why?)</p>
<p>Yglesias in 2016: My guess in a Trump administration angry mobs will beat and murder Jews and people of color with impunity.<br />
Yet after Oct 7, that's what exactly happened to Jews, especially across universities to Jews by Muslim immigrants and leftist activists, which didn’t alarm Yglesias that much. In fact, even before Oct 7, many young black men in NYC were savaging Orthodox Jews on the streets through random violence. But yes, in a Trump administration, angry mobs will beat and murder Jews and people of color with impunity.</p>
<p>Yglesias mocked the alarm about Wokefulness for years (see his tweets from as recently as 2019) and was forced to acknowledge it, which he did only half-heartedly and sheepishly until a few years ago. Tyler called this on a podcast he did with Ezra Klein in about 2016 or so (good for him.)</p>
<p>A partisan hack who celebrates the brazen Lawfare tactics against Trump in the Alvin Bragg case. Anyone who celebrated the lawfare against Trump, where the Manhattan DA fabricated 30+ felonies to hurt Trump, should not be taken seriously at all on matters of civics and "authoritarianism."</p>
<p>He is dishonest even on policy and not just politics. For example, Yglesias is here celebrating the rank dishonesty in the media coverage of the 2017 GOP tax cuts because the Dems benefited from it a lot in the midterms — “Nobody likes to give themselves credit for this kind of messaging success, but progressive groups did a really good job of convincing people that Trump raised their taxes when the facts say a clear majority got a tax cut.”</p>
<p>Yglesias before the Biden-Trump debate in June, when it was no longer possible for the Democrat-Media Complex to lie about Biden’s senility.<br />
Yglesias 1 day before the debate: It’s interesting that Joe Biden’s dementia is most visible in deceptively cropped video clips but easily covered-up by performance-enhancing drugs during high-profile extended public appearance</p>
<p>Yglesias in Nov 2023: The best proof of Biden’s senility is that he answered a question accurately.</p>
<p>Yglesias on Robert Hur’s supposed scandalous misconduct is for Merrick Garland to resign, apologize, and make a big stink. Yglesias was slandering Robert Hur in general after the Hur report.</p>
<p>Matthew Yglesias did an emergency podcast 1 day after the debate so that he could explain that Joe Biden’s performance last night is attributed entirely to the stutter he’s had for his entire life. Meanwhile, Biden himself acknowledges that he is experiencing age-related decline.</p>
<p>Bonus Pravda-esque lie from Krugman on Biden’s senility:<br />
Krugman four months ago: "As anyone who has recently spent time with Biden (and I have) can tell you, he is in full possession of his faculties — completely lucid and with excellent grasp of detail."</p>
<p>Dishonest hacks. All of them.</p>

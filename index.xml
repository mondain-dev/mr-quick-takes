Which is a fascinating discussion - what will be the incentives for AI, and why should they have any connection to human incentives?</p>
<p>We might be able, with a certain degree of empathy, to understand animal incentives, at least ones somewhat like us such as dogs, or ones less easily understood existing in s a 3d world such as whales or dolphins. But understanding incentives in this sense would be a mistake dealing with AI, and one already seen in how many people anthropomorphize AI.</p>
<p>Yes, Tyler, forget that mood affiliation cliche (it's not happening except her), and realize you possess a natural religious calling for animism.</p>

<p>IMO this is the problem with raising taxes in the US: evernyone knows we *would not* get the money back in sensible services and investments that generally benefit the broader population; the government in power would simply steer the money to whatever "investment" their religious zeal is for at the moment (and which enhances the wealth of their constituents), however worthless that would be in the long run.</p>
<p>In that sense Scott Sumner is right: the US has become a banana republic, with the government seeking to return favors to its benefactors, not to benefit the general population.</p>

I don't want to get sucked into that rabbit hole, but there's a problem there that I'm not sure either SA or RH appreciate: medical interventions are a "becoming" not a "being". That is, they're not static. What I mean is that an intervention is context sensitive. Not only does the training of the medical team matter, but the number of cases (training set?) matters too. I'd rather have a mediocre brain surgeon at a 1st rate neurosurgery center (who does several of the procedures a week) than a star surgeon at a small rural hospital (who does a maybe handful of the surgeries per yr). That is, training, practice, and infrastructure/support all matter in distinguishing between  "good" and "bad" medicine, and all of those thins are dynamic - changing continually. Good luck trying to distinguish between the "good" and the "bad"- except retrospectively. (Although, there are certainly good ways to assign the probability of a good/bad outcome, given the particular context. Those ways may not be legal, given HIPAA.)</p>

I've little doubt that if you asked them the right questions they'd say that's why they do it, but I also seriously doubt anyone actually sat down and said "I'm going to build a cathedral because that'll get me X rewards in the afterlife." They do it because it's what you do in this culture. </p>
<p>Most groups in the past had a performative element, which is done for its own sake. Things that simply aren't questioned. Diet is a great place to look for this--why don't we eat goat routinely in the USA? Because it's not done. Outside of diet, though, we in the USA live in an incredibly utilitarian society, and tend to view any performative aspect as either an evil to be culled, or as not REALLY performative, they're doing it because of X, Y, and Z value they think they're getting from it. It leads to a lot of errors when assessing other cultures.</p>

And that's just the supply side. I don't see any shortage of demand for low-skilled work: we can do with more automatic cleaners so we can have more gardeners, cashiers so we can have more shop advisors, automated taxis so we can have more barristas, and machine peeled potatoes so we can have more real chefs. So-so AI innovation is fine by me. If anything I am worried that the abundance of low skilled workers is one of the reasons productivity is not growing fast enough. People surely know that one of the theories as to why the industrial revolution started in England, not France, was their shortage of manual labor. That's the positive side. On the normative side, I understand that it is a pitiful state of affairs if young people, willing to build a more prosperous future for themselves, are barred from leaving their dysfunctional states. One can make the argument that facilitating immigration for these young and ambitious people is a moral imperative (it often fails on the practicalities when people insist on awarding identical benefits to the newcomers). But this is a two-way street: perhaps we can also do more to export good governance to countries that are currently incapable of governing themselves and tie this to mutually beneficial free-trade agreement. Quite possibly, the European refugee crisis could have been prevented had Europe agreed to expand its existing free-trade agreement with Turkey to also cover services and public procurement and offered tax incentives for Western companies to settle in designated economic zones near refugee camps.</p>

<p>Now we have "artificial barriers to migration" - not stupid unions or policies protecting American indigents - driving the adoption of scary "AI" - which isn't actually AI at all! :)</p>
<p>The Orwellian world is upon us.  History is being rewritten as we speak to implicate the evils of freedom and profit in all of society's ills.</p>

I don't think he argues that "we" - aka society - should be telling management what to do with AI.  More like we should remove the artificial barriers to labor.</p>
<p>OTOH, he has not considered that we have artificial barriers to utilizing the labor we have here already - we call them "entitlements".  Some aren't even specified as such, for example as I pointed out below, people are now entitled to the right to squat on public land, so they no longer need an income to afford drugs and a place to live.</p>

<p>I wouldn't count on legacy cash being phased out in 10 years, though. See my comment above about some jurisdictions - typically deep blue areas - enacting laws that require retail businesses to accept cash.</p>
<p>And these laws are typically fairly recent. The LA City Council passed its ordinance in late 2023, for example.</p>
<p>The rationale to date has typically been progressive arguments about the unbanked, and stats on racial/ethnic/income composition of that group.</p>
<p>Wouldn't surprise me, though, if similar laws at some point get traction in red areas due to some combo of Dave Ramsey finance types, "I don't want to be tracked" libertarian-ish views, and the increasing suspicion of big business among Republicans.</p>

<p>AI is very good at handling that. And since that is such a common use case, AI will probably be part of every ordering system we might envision, whether we like it or not. And strangely, the tech to handle chaotic ordering has really just arrived with GPT3.5</p>

<p>I don't get how you figure that.  There are thousands of "workers" smoking dope in homeless camps doing SFA.  In the mean time, who knows how many *high paying* jobs are being killed by the relentless march of regulation - such as, in Seattle you're not allowed to build a house on your property bigger than adjacent homes - even though many many people want to do that - wealthy people who would hire skilled tradesman to do the work.  </p>
<p>Meantime, while dope is proliferating throughout society there is a massive shortage of drivers - in part because if you've even been busted for even a small toke, you have no chance in hell of driving a commercial vehicle.  </p>
<p>And, of course, there is the $20 min wage for unskilled workers, which is obviously putting a crimp on demand.</p>
<p>We're in the middle of the Democrats' Great Leap Forward.   Wait until their engery policies take effect.  Then you'll see a huge jump in demand for labor.  (not)</p>

</blockquote><p>To me this is a strong signal Apple management has no clue, but I agree that's the right decision.</p>
<p>The last product that has added material bottom line is the Apple Watch, which was the last product Jony Ive was involved in developing. They've released the AirTags and the Vision since then. Vision has potential and is great hardware but Apple's heart doesn't appear to be in it, and it still suffers the same problems all VR systems have - namely there is still no 'must have' app.  </p>
<p>The car was canceled. </p>
<p>Siri is woefully behind every other AI assistant, and Apple appears lost more generally on AI. </p>
<p>The iphone and ipad are incremental at best and have been for 5+ years. It's really a battery replacement decision and hopefully a few other things have gotten better. </p>
<p>The Apple / Android  ecosystems are largely stable in terms of market share now, and even a hit product isn't likely to change it materially. </p>
<p>So unless they have a really big secret product launch up their sleeves, which seems implausible in this day and age, it's shifted to a mature phase company.</p>

</blockquote><p>For it to be a signal pointed out by a great public intellectual wouldn’t it need a really high correlation? They send out this signal 4 times a year. Their 2022 buys were not an ‘all in’ you should’ve heeded unless you’re a buy’n’hold, in which case, if you like Apple, you have, or will.</p>
<p>https://stockbuybackshistory.com/aapl/?utm_source=popup_no</p>
<p>Tyler is a bright light in an area filled with too much Doesn’t Matter, but, buybacks are semi-controversial. Why should a company be able to deduct nearly $4 billion in interest expense while using 10s of billions to buyback shares? Erase the debt. Or, don’t expense the interest.</p>
<p>Then there are the egregious PE situations in which their takeovers are not profitable, are loaded with debt, then pay out a dividend while interest is deducted.</p>
<p>Buybacks reduce share count before options &amp; ESOPs, raise EPS without raising earnings, do not commit the company to regular dividends and, as the chart shows, do not establish a floor or a ST signal. More often than not for companies buybacks occur at highs, not lows. That’s when companies have cash.</p>
<p>European companies have an annual, quite often variable dividend or a special dividend at year’s end. Annual is unattractive for income investors. A quarterly base plus special or quarterlies + annual special dividend would be preferable.</p>
<p>In Apple’s case, around $5/share, leaving the remainder, $30 billion, to buyback the needed shares for employee programs and reduce share count.</p>

</blockquote><p>You may be right.  I am no insider, with inside knowledge.  But I have heard a different explanation, that Apple "could not find the differentiator."  That is, if we believe that Apple's strategy is to enable a price premium over rival products thanks to a better user experience, it could not find the better user experience in cars.  Basic functionality of cars (stop start steer etc.) is a commodity.  Electric drive shrinks performance gaps dramatically (almost any premium EV is faster 0-60 than even Ferraris of a decade ago).  Autonomy (if it works) REMOVES a dimension of differentiation: if I am just sitting in my comfy seat then the car company cannot impress me with road feel or the thrill of taut steering, etc.  So what am I left with?  Ever-plusher interiors?  Maybe, but Tesla has pushed people away from that ("spartan is better").  Ever better audiovisual, infotainment interfaces?  Competition is beyond intense here and I can't see spending an extra $20,000 (e.g.) for a better version of CarPlay.  Exterior styling?  Maybe, but styling is easily replicated.  Car sharing?  (Enabling my car to be used by others who will pay me a fee to do so?)  Maybe, but part of the iPhone's appeal is to show you have one.  Ever tried to borrow an iPhone from a friend for a few hours?  Anyway, my personal belief is that they couldn't find the differentiator, and every year they waited the competition closed any gap anyway: EV range got longer, ADAS and near-autonomy advanced, interior sound systems added a dozen more speakers, seats became not only heated but ventilated and even massaging, etc.  IMHO anyway.</p>

Cowen is confusing national wealth with individual wealth, odd from the founder of a blog called marginal revolution. Individual wealth actually matters, to their families if not to economists. I had to bring this to Tabarrok's attention years ago, and he commented that he hadn't thought about it that way.</p>
</blockquote><p>Rayward: this is a stupid plan that, like almost every other stupid democrat proposal, does nothing to deal with the actual problem, which is the rising cost of homes, driven by the rising number of idiot Democrat/Progtard bureaucrats creating a rising number of rules and handouts and permits and permissions that reduce the supply and drive up the cost of houses.  </p>
<p>It would be nice if we could say this is done out of mere stupidity, but that's unfortunately not the case.  It's done to create and protect patronage jobs that splash money around to progtards and democrats.  </p>
<p>You might thing we could address the actual problem, but doing that would be efficient, which would create two problems for The Progtardery: 1) the progtards need ever more regulation so the money is under as many different shells as possible and thus it's more difficult to figure out who its going to; 2) an efficient economy with fewer rules would mean the Progtards would have to go out and do something useful, which is a severe hardship on people who believe they should be able to direct everyone to do what they want to do.</p>

We used to associate age with wisdom, and sought the advice and counsel of seniors but not so much anymore. What is "knowledge"? Is it mainly the information, the data, that is stored in our brains? Is it the ability to use that data analytically for better decision-making? Or is it merely about access to data: the ability to mine vast quantities of data stored on a hard drive? If it's the latter, then what's a human good for? The human brain will shrink as the A.I.'s brain expands. In science fiction of the past, humans were depicted as having large heads and shrunken bodies, the former from use and the latter from non-use. Today's science fiction would depict the opposite: large, well-developed bodies (all that leisure time while A.I. does the "work") and a shrunken head (the human brain has less to do).</p>
<p>An aside, loss of respect for seniors has two sources. One, the absence of a well-developed access ability: seniors don't even know how to use computers to access all the data available. Two, advancements in medicine and nutrition: seniors are living longer and (call them) "super seniors" have less cognition. In my profession, law, "senior partners" were highly valued for their "knowledge". Not so much any more: they've been sent out to pasture to make room for the young, smart lawyers who know how to use not only computers but A.I. Here's one noticeable difference: "senior partners" require their assistants to print a hard copy for them to read (contracts, pleadings, letters, research product, etc.) while youthful lawyers don't print anything: they read everything on the monitor. I'm old but I adopted the habit of using my computers to create, read, and store all the data in my practice, while few lawyers my age ever did. To emphasize the point, if I email (a digital copy of) a document to a "senior partner", it likely will disappear in the bowels of his hard drive once his assistant prints a hard copy. "Senior partners" still rely on file cabinets not computer files. And their assistants adopt the same filing method: they never learn to create files and sub-files and sub-sub files because the "senior partners" wouldn't access them, and wouldn't know how. This overly long paragraph makes the point about how seniors don't have the same respect as they once did because they lack the skills to "access the data". And this isn't something will will disappear with the current generation, as the data and the access to the data continue to evolve and with it the skills to access and use it effectively. "Senior partners" will get younger and younger until "don't trust anyone over age 30" becomes reality. Good luck with that.</p>
<p>Not that any of this matters. I learned last night that there is a large collection of meteors traveling through space leaving a path of destruction in its wake, and that it passes earth every 12,000 years. That's a relief. No it's not: the last time it passed the earth was 11,970 years ago. Have a nice day.</p>
</blockquote><p>Scratch the last paragraph. Last night I fell asleep watching a podcast on my i-pad, and woke up to loud voices several hours later from a podcast six years ago. I won't mention the participants, but I didn't realize I had awaken to a podcast recorded six years ago, as I listened to impending doom from an asteroid. Anyway, that is an old issue that, like many, came and went, I suppose like podcasts generally. Anyway, it was a podcast by a host I never listen to (although his guests are favorites of mine), and why it came on my i-pad while I was asleep is a mystery. Maybe my dog did it. Anyway, we still have 24 years to go, but even with six years cut from doomsday, I won't be around for the show.</p>

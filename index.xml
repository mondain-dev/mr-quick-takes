<p>This sounds super scary and doom-and-gloom, but in reality is pretty smart. We're seeing some major changes in things like flooding patterns and stream flow issues, both of which translate to erosion issues. Having your infrastructure collapse because of known issues like this makes you a bad engineer. </p>
<p>There are, no doubt, sustainability requirements--the company I work for deals with them as well--but they're not that hard to deal with. You can do things like use Teams instead of in-person meetings, use drones and 360 cameras for site walks instead of flying people out, use companies that use non-petroleum based lubricants in their heavy equipment (harder to find, but they do exist), things like that. These can be mutually contradictory to a certain extent--companies that use non-petroleum based lubricants may need to drive in from fairly far away, for example--but environmental stuff is always like that. There are few actually good options; the vast majority of the time you're dealing with cost/benefit analysis and picking which costs you're willing to bear. </p>
<p>It's also a fact that a lot of the sustainability tracking is going to be BS tossed together by some junior employee. I won't go so far as to say a lot of this is made up, but there's a lot of "Oh yeah, we can count that towards our sustainability goals can't we?" Like, if someone's sick so they call into a meeting instead of showing up. What happens a LOT is someone finds a way to do something faster, or tweaks the design to use less gas/materials/whatever (designs always change once they encounter reality, every project has redlines), and that gets added into the sustainability tracker as an afterthought.<br />
 <br />
Further, we have no idea where we started at 3 years ago. If we started at the design phase, 3 years is not a lot for a major construction project. Remember, you're not just tossing out wires; you're digging trenches and dealing with utilities (overhead and underground) and waterways and the like. Procurement can take a while as well, especially today (with the Panama Canal struggling and the Suez Canal being blocked by raiders). The bid process can take a while, especially if someone decides to press charges (people who lose multi-million dollar projects tend to object). For that matter, figuring out how to bid it can take forever. We're talking NATION-WIDE here; this absolutely will not be a single project, but since rural by definition means out in the middle of nowhere looking at how to divide up the regions for bid will take a while. Add to that you have multiple federal, state, county, township, municipal, and other entities that will vie for control here. </p>
<p>Where we were 3 years ago is a critical bit of information that's completely left out; we're supposed to say "Oh goodness me!" and clutch our pearls and not think about this, I suppose. It's Argument by Contextless Big Scary Number. </p>
<p>This post confirms that the authors of this blog have very little familiarity with the construction industry.</p>

</blockquote><p>The fact that you consider all of this "normal" is sort of indicative that the problem is much broader and deeper than Alex is even saying. It's not just  this one project, it's all government contracting. Yes, of course we all we knew this. Has anyone actually ever calculated the cost? Can you imagine what our costs and schedules would look like if we didn't have any of this to deal with?</p>

I worked and lived in Europe for a U.S. company as a software developer/manager. I got to know a lot of peers at other companies. The prevailing attitude of European managers toward software developers was that they are glorified typists and they pay accordingly. My direct colleagues were very happy to be able to work for a U.S. company at close to U.S. salaries while still living in Europe. Other developers I knew had the dilemma of moving to the U.S. to make better salaries or staying in Europe. The best of them moved. Obviously good for U.S. productivity and bad for Europe's. But, the point is that this isn't really regulation driven, but cultural.</p>
<p>Patrick McKenzie (patio11) makes the same points about working in Japan.</p>
<p>I should note that managers in the U.S. had the same attitudes back in the 1980s but this gradually changed. Hopefully, it's in the process of changing in Europe.</p>

</blockquote><p>Also mobile phones weren't a thing in 1980, so a lot of lingering would be hanging round waiting for people you'd arranged to meet in a well-known public spot.</p>

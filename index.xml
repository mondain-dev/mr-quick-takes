Have they been enough to reach replacement? Clearly not, but that is one hell of an ask in our world today. Context is very important.</p>
<p>In 2011, TFR in Hungary was 1.23. In 2023 it was 1.50.</p>
<p>For South Korea, TFR was 1.24 in 2011. In 2023 it was 0.72.<br />
For Poland, TFR was 1.33 in 2011. In 2023, it was 1.18.<br />
For Turkey, TFR was 2.13 in 2011. In 2023, it was 1.51.<br />
For China, TFR was 1.67 in 2011. In 2023, in was 1.02.<br />
For Chile, TFR was 1.82 in 2011. In 2023, it was 1.15.<br />
For Argentina, TFR was 2.34 in 2011. In 2023, it was 1.35.<br />
For the USA, TFR was 1.89 in 2011. In 2023, it was 1.62.<br />
So Hungary is performing a lot better than it might otherwise.<br />
(Latest TFR stats are from @BirthGauge on X, an account whose entire MO is tracking fertility from the latest government reports worldwide. Whereas sources like WorldBank and the UN tend to be several-years-old data).</p>
<p>So Hungary made some decent headway swimming upstream while the rest of the world was carried swiftly downstream to the edge of the waterfall! That's something, right?</p>
<p>The fertility collapse problem is just gnarly and any progress in a world where most countries are in birth rate free fall are a very big deal! (As for 5% of the budget, it's a lot but I wouldn't think twice about spending 5% of my income if I had a genuinely life-threatening condition.)</p>
<p>Hungary also loses large numbers of young people, especially of the ambitious sort, to out-migration elsewhere in the EU, so the raw number of births will take a big hit from that factor.</p>
<p>Has Hungary's program been a success? I would say yes, with a qualification:<br />
Culture (especially things like religiosity) matter more, and the broader global culture is clearly quite anti-natal at the moment. Religion is arguably much bigger influence than tax policy and there has been no religious revival in Hungary.</p>

Like, why not do away with summer break so that kids with the IQ to do college can start college at age 15 or 14 or whenever? And why have summer break in college, instead of 3 semesters a year? and why 8 semesters for college instead of 6? Why do law degrees take 3 years, when most of the lawyers I know said that they had learned everything they needed to know pass the bar in the first year of law school? Granted, delayed marriage due to capstone marriages hasn't been a problem for industrialized societies before now. But it seems like one obvious thing that would help is to change the way educations, careers, housing, etc. work so that people can achieve those capstones earlier in life and hence get married and start having kids earlier in life.</p>

<p>Judging by the output of university science over the last few decades - relentless natural crisis forecasting that never occurs; replication disaster in social sciences - they're not ready for it, period, at any age, at any time.

It would basically produce the same design from the opposite direction of the process you're describing. These things would add a level of complexity that doesn't add anything to the actual product--it's like buying a sports car just to drive a few dozen yards down your driveway to pick up the mail. </p>
<p>I will admit that dates are extremely hard to come by for when wire weaving started. So it could be that this started more complex, but became less so once a simpler method was discovered. That said, there are a few reasons to doubt this. </p>
<p>The objects are limited geographically, and to colder areas; there's nothing inherent in wire weaving of any kind that would make temperature a factor. Second, wire weaving leaves marks on the thing you're working with. Gold is soft as far as metals go, but the tools you need to do it aren't and you sometimes need to put a bit of force in to get the thing off the peg even if you're dealing with thread. Such marks are not present in the artifacts. Finally, at least as far as I've seen (not an exhaustive search, admittedly) there doesn't appear to be a lot of woven wire jewelry floating around Rome. To justify a complex manufacturing process you'd expect there to be a significant demand, but we don't see that. We see a lot of wire rings, wire necklaces, and the like, but they're shaped via different processes. In contrast, in the post-Roman world, especially in Northern Europe, we see numerous examples of wire weaving in jewelry and other applications.</p>

Those knobs look perfect for wrapping thread around, so if the holes are for measuring fingers, then that lines up nicely. Except if that were the case, wouldn't we probably see more of them with wear, and might we not also see less precious versions? I feel like it still would have still been beneficial to keep using a damaged one instead of melting it down, to avoid the expense and time loss of getting it reforged, or maybe to try making a replacement out of wood or something. It would be a bit weird if a useful tool only existed in lightly used deluxe collector's editions, you know what I mean? I guess my intuition on how many cheap tools survive more than a millennium might be overly optimistic, but still, it seems odd to me.</p>
<p>If we imagine the tools also had some kind of wealth signaling value or religious function which outweighed any practical utility, then the lack of cheap and/or damaged versions is easier to explain, but then again "religious and/or status symbol" is the traditional fallback for anything archaeologists can't explain, so it's a little disappointing to have to default to that.</p>
<p>I don't really have any better answers though. Dungeons &amp; Dragons keeps coming to my mind. Were Roman nerds sitting in the basement of their mom's villa, pretending to be elves and hoping for a natural 20, just like me in the 21st century? Probably not, but it's an amusing mental image, and nobody has yet disproven it.</p>

<p>Yeah, that's one of the bigger holes in this idea. I wonder if taphonomy may not be an explanation here--whether there were wooden versions of these, but they weren't preserved, and the metal ones were used for specific tasks that didn't produce as much wear. (Though that seems bass-ackwards to me). Wooden versions of this, being more fragile, would have been more prone to being destroyed, and would have rotted away. Still, you're right, you'd expect to see a few of them lying around. </p>
<p>(The taphonomic issue raises the possibility that we're not seeing the whole device--that these were just individual pieces to some larger thing, who's other pieces are lost or haven't been identified. I sort of doubt it, though; I'd think we'd have found some evidence given the number of these we have.) </p>
<p>These wouldn't be terribly easy to make, either by fabrication or casting--it's a complex shape that would require a fair bit of skill. Could be that they were also used as a way to test smiths, or for smiths to show off. It's practical, but not commonly used (because there'd be cheaper ones), and it shows that your smith is better than mine. We know that Romans thought that way, and displayed wealth in various ways to show how rich and powerful they were. "I can give my wife a an expensive version of a tool she rarely even uses" is a pretty strong statement of one's wealth. </p>
<p>I'll be the first to admit that this is highly speculative at this point. </p>
<p>As an aside, I'm curious about the timeline...I've never read anything showing when and where these things came from. Rome wasn't horrible at innovation, but they were masters at adopting technologies. A lot of the "Roman" gear was stuff they picked up from cultures they conquered (the gladius being perhaps the most iconic). I could see Roman ladies finding a useful tool, adopting it, then it becoming fashionable and being adapted in rather wild directions. It's happened before--see pointed toes in Medieval shoes for an example. </p>
<p>"Dungeons &amp; Dragons keeps coming to my mind." </p>
<p>https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/551072</p>
<p>There's stronger evidence--there's historical evidence of Greek and Roman d20 dice. Not sure about the rest--it's hard to find good sources. And this sort of thing is as good an explanation of some of the weirder manuscripts I've come across as anything else in academia.</p>

<p>Given the two options, we definitely want him to start minting trillion dollar coins like a moron. If the Fed is involved, or even tacitly supports it,  Allies and countries that use the US dollar as reserve will view the dollar as far less stable and more vulnerable to politics. Without an independent Fed, I fear the US will lose its status as reserve currency forever, and all the goodies that go with that. If Trump just prints a bunch of money, we can all scream and yell he's a moron, and you can hang it on his head, and hope everyone sticks around for the dollar once he's gone. </p>
<p>He's also much less likely to unilaterally print money, as he will bear all the blame. </p>
<p>I understand your RealPolitcking, but honestly its crazy to think that the Fed fighting against Trump doing stupid things is worse than the Fed helping him do stupid things. </p>
<p>"I just do not see how you can hope to have an executive that thinks it can shuffle around a few trillion in borrowing liabilities and hope to keep fiscal policy out of its reach."</p>
<p>You cant keep fiscal policy out of his reach. But you can keep the independence of the Federal Reserve out of his reach. I don't understand why you think giving that up would help.</p>

The Feds only solution to Trump threatening to take down America is not to HELP. That's a crazy rationalization."<br />
We got it you dislike the idea. So what should the Fed actually DO? </p>
<p>Trump says he wants a weak dollar. The Fed says buzz off. Fed mints the trillion dollar coins. What then?</p>
<p>What precisely do you think the Fed should do? Publish a sternly worded letter?</p>
<p>"If they give in, he will keep making demands until they are forced to fight him. Dont be naive. They cant protect the money from Trump, all they can protect is their independence so they still have it once Trump leaves."<br />
I'm sorry but absent active counter measures, if Trump prints a trillion dollar coin or uses discretion to change lending behavior what of their "independence" is left? The Fed's independence is valuable and frankly exists because people think that the Fed can control (to some degree) the money supply. I mean United States Notes are still legal tender and nothing actually stops Trump from just running monetary policy through that channel via platinum coinage aside from decency, decorum, and danger aversion ... which maybe your view of Trump's character is different than mine but I don't hold out that much hope. </p>
<p>"You ARE missing something. Apparently the ONLY thing. Trump has those current statutory powers. The Fed reducing rates for Trump does not suddenly make those powers go away. So they agree to reduce rates. Then what? Nothing has changed, except Trump knows he can bully the Fed. They got NOTHING in return."<br />
They get a more precise implementation of his policies rather than some confidence destroying WAG about how platinum coinage or whatever he needs.</p>
<p>And it is not like they have leverage here. If they cave he holds a loaded gun to their head. If they don't cave he holds a loaded gun to their head.</p>
<p>Maybe the horse will learn to fly, but I just do not see a lot of ways for them keep the system together if Trump really is that power mad. Unless you think he is somehow mythically restrained by respect for institutional authority all defying him does is end up with all the bad impacts of his policy(ies) plus whatever results from him using all his statutory powers. </p>
<p>It is not like there is a stable reserve currency to return to once he leaves office if the standoff means that he gives everyone a 10% haircut off the top.</p>

<p>We might be able, with a certain degree of empathy, to understand animal incentives, at least ones somewhat like us such as dogs, or ones less easily understood existing in s a 3d world such as whales or dolphins.

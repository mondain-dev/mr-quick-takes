Seems like it’s good when it’s against alcohol (which Tyler does not like - https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/06/do-we-need-antitrust-action-against-big-alcohol.html) but bad when it’s about speeding (which is similarly fatal and bad but Tyler likes?). Also a rare instance of the comments being more measured than the post!</p>

</blockquote><p>I do not want to downplay the troubles of men, which I think are important and growing. But I'm not sure women are doing that great.<br />
They seem increasingly neurotic, anxious, and insecure - more so than ever. Moreover, they are using their dominant political position to attempt to address their perceived problems. However, for the most part they are wielding their political power on ineffective policies that mainly reinforce their misguided perception that they lack power. This is turning the political cycle into a kind of positive feedback loop of feminine grievances.</p>

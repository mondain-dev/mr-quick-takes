However, confirming those discoveries most definitely used the scientific method in all its rigorous glory.</p>
<p>"A hallmark of Albert Einstein's career was his use of visualized thought experiments as a fundamental tool for understanding physical issues and for elucidating his concepts to others. Einstein's thought experiments took diverse forms. In his youth, he mentally chased beams of light. For special relativity, he employed moving trains and flashes of lightning to explain his most penetrating insights. For general relativity, he considered a person falling off a roof, accelerating elevators, blind beetles crawling on curved surfaces and the like. "</p>
<p>"A thought experiment is a logical argument or mental model cast within the context of an imaginary (hypothetical or even counterfactual) scenario. A scientific thought experiment, in particular, may examine the implications of a theory, law, or set of principles with the aid of fictive and/or natural particulars (demons sorting molecules, cats whose lives hinge upon a radioactive disintegration, men in enclosed elevators) in an idealized environment (massless trapdoors, absence of friction). They describe experiments that, except for some specific and necessary idealizations, could conceivably be performed in the real world.</p>
<p>As opposed to physical experiments, thought experiments do not report new empirical data."</p>

<p>Steve</p>
</blockquote><p>Of course they do. Europeans consider walking (and in a number of countries, bicycling) in their neighborhoods a normal activity, from young children to the elderly. Car driving is a relatively new social change in societies that were exclusively pedestrian (except for a few horses) a century and a half ago. America is a true outlier in this regard, for a variety of reasons.</p>

<p>Challenges and Considerations<br />
Cost of Development and Approval: The process of modifying the drug and conducting the necessary clinical trials is expensive and time-consuming. For a generic drug like ambroxol, the return on investment might be questionable unless the new version offers significant advantages over the original.</p>
<p>Market Competition: There are already several mucolytic agents available in the U.S. market. Introducing a slightly modified version of ambroxol might not be enough to guarantee substantial market share, especially if healthcare providers and patients are already satisfied with existing treatments.</p>
<p>Regulatory Hurdles: The FDA has stringent requirements for approving new drugs or modified versions of existing drugs. The company would need to demonstrate that the new version is safe and effective, which requires robust clinical data. The FDA might not grant approval if the modifications are deemed too minor or if the benefits over the original are not clear.</p>
<p>Profitability Concerns: Since ambroxol is cheap and widely available as a generic in other markets, pricing the new version competitively while recouping development costs could be challenging.</p>
</blockquote><p>Keeping in mind, of course, that GPT-4 makes up bullshit all the time and is generally unreliable.  </p>
<p>But it's interesting that it says "There are already several mucolytic agents available in the U.S. market. "  Is that true?  If so...why do we have this column?</p>

Some want to legalize all recreational drugs, even heroin. The logic tends to be an emphasis on our personal freedom and the racist harm of the drug war. At the same time they hate modern medicine and "Big Pharma" (except COVID-19 vaccines) and won't speed up approval of something as banal as sunscreens already legal in other rich nations. There is a strong tendency to want to regulate new drugs, medicines, and even food for our "safety" or even ban them. They're willing to trust adults to take meth but not necessarily a novel new pain or heart medication because it <i>might</i> be dangerous. </p>
<p>Before anyone jumps in with a "What about the Republicans????", I know they have their own set of problems, I'm just trying to figure out leftist logic on this. What exactly are their priorities?

<p>They don't like profit, but they especially don't like anything that would make one [person, corporation] earn more than another, bcz that shatters the belief that we're all just different color M&amp;Ms and that blue, green red and yellow must be distributed proportionally across the cookie according to some natural law.</p>

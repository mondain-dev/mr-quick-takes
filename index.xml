So did my ancestors' neighbors in Britain until the Romans mostly stopped it. As Rome fell my ancestors kidnapped a young Roman citizen teenager named Patricius and brought him back to their home to tend sheep. He escaped to France and came back 20+- years later to covert my savage ancestors to Christianity while building monasteries and copying books.</p>
<p>IAC, ritual human sacrifice was halted and replaced by reading paperback bodice rippers.</p>
<p>They rest is history ... so they say ...</p>
<p>I have to admit, every once in a while I feel cracking someone's skull with a stone axe but then I think, "nah, f*ck it" and carry on.</p>

To the degree that there are men who serial date and "oligopolize" large numbers of women (and I think it's often overblown, but maybe a real thing), the described phenom at the link is the necessary corollary of the "incels" complaint about this.</p>
<p>"Protecting Women And Girls" blather is always more likely to actually get something done though, so perhaps that would be a shift in marketing strategy for folks who wish to promote early monogamous marriage that would work better than showing the slightest concern for single young men.</p>

Specifically:  </p>
<p>1) Repair or replace bridges that are past their useful lifespan or have low rates on inspections. Think of it this way: One of the biggest military assets in any invasion is the bridges. By failing to maintain or replace these, we are essentially declaring war on ourselves and suffering some of the consequences of an enemy invasion merely through our own sloth. The warnings about bridge collapses are remarkably similar to the warnings about the New Orleans levies I heard prior to Katrina--experts shouting as loudly as they can "This will kill people!!" and everyone ignoring them because no one's died yet. As a bonus, this is a way to get bipartisan support--more efficient construction methods would decrease ecological impact and environmental costs, while also increasing blue-collar work for decades. </p>
<p>2) The electrical grid. We CANNOT transmit enough electricity to power the future; in some cases we can't even power today. An astonishing amount of our electrical grid is past its useful lifespan as well. The future will be more energy intensive. We should be building the infrastructure to handle this load now, rather than reactively building in response to disasters. </p>
<p>3) Mine asteroids. This is a bit pie-in-the-sky, but the rewards would be tremendous so I'd think it's worth trying. The elements we need to build existing technology, to say nothing of future technology, are considered rare-earth elements because they fell below the crust during the fractionation the Earth went through as it cooled. Asteroids did not undergo that process, and key elements that are rare on Earth are practically as common as iron in these asteroids. We know we can grab material and bring it back; we know we can manipulate asteroid orbital paths. Let's park one in orbit (around the Moon or at a LaGrange point, so it doesn't smack into our planet accidently) and mine the sucker.</p>

There’s really nothing these men can do if women in the 3-9 range keep sleeping with male 10s in the hopes of eventually ensnaring one. The male 10s will eventually settle down, if at all, with a female 10, but in the meantime they’re happy to sleep with the 3-10s. This is an equilibrium that only women can break.</p>

<p>Potatoes were huge for Europe, but less so for China.  I suppose they were fine with the rice and wheat they were already growing, whereas potatoes could produce unprecedented food yields for places such as Ireland.  (I did observe that fried potatoes were a very popular street food in ChongQing.   Not something that we normally associate with Sichuan cuisine -- but these fried potatoes had red chiles mixed in.)</p>
<p>Maize may've done something similar for sub-Saharan Africa, it seemed to be widespread not just in cities but in the hinterlands too:</p>
<p>"Maize accounts for 30−50% of low-income household expenditures in Africa. Over 30% of the caloric intake of people in sub‐Saharan Africa comes from maize."<br />
https://www.iita.org/cropsnew/maize/</p>
<p>Chocolate/cocoa is more of a luxury product than a staple, it's also widespread but though it's certainly available in places such as Africa and China it's not as commonly seen as maize, potatoes, etc.</p>
<p>But though those New World foods revolutionized cuisine and nutrition worldwide, the continents that were really revolutionized were the Americas, where the Europeans brought beef, pork, wheat, onions, rice, bananas (from Africa, but via the colonizers), etc. etc.  Interestingly the Incas had chickens -- that had to have been brought by Polynesians.</p>

Clark, and so on, to collect a detailed catalogue of predilections for specific and less specific dates in the future. Everyone should try to get their hands on this book, and re-read it every five years or so, as I do. It’s a great corrective to the bad habit of couching our biases and opinion in the form of predictions. So many of these expert opinions are spectacularly wrong, and some are so startlingly right (up to a point), that it is also immensely entertaining. (Nobel-winner Friedman, by the way, is asked to predict future winners of the Nobel in Economics. His guesses in 1981 were George Stiegler, Gary Becker, Martin Feldstein, Robert Lucas and Franco Modigliani. That’s two correct, if I’m not mistaken.)</p>

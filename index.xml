<p>But given that people are currently living there, if a disaster strikes we don't want to leave them high and dry (nor under water).</p>
<p>But what we can say is this:  if your house is in an overly high-risk flood zone, you can put in an insurance claim and get reimbursed for your loss and rebuild your house -- as long as you don't rebuild it in a forbidden zone.</p>
<p>No one gets wiped out financially (if they are insured), and in the long run the intruding  overly risky houses go away.  And the barrier islands are returned to their natural state, as well as their natural function of occasionally flooding  and moving and appearing and disappearing.</p>

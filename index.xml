The sight of military police everywhere, fully masked, was a bit unsettling. One particular moment stands out: we had driven to the far end of a peninsula and we were kind, with nowhere to go but back where we came from. A military police officer was watching me carefully, the obvious foreigner, and then pulled his neoprene mask from his neck up over his nose. It felt like a strange and threatening gesture at first, but then I realized it was just a courtesy for COVID. In 2022, mask compliance in El Salvador was incredibly strict. I still remember seeing a woman walking alone on the side of the road in a rainforest, with no one within a mile of her, fully masked.</p>
<p>I wonder if it’s still like that now. I hadn’t expected such high compliance in a country like El Salvador. </p>
<p>Still, we had a wonderful time. The beach was fantastic and essentially empty. The national museum in San Salvador was fascinating, and a hike up to the Boqueron volcano was a lot of fun. And of course, like Tyler notes above, eating pupusas in the very remote areas was always a delightful experience. And some of the most interesting times was just shopping in the local supermarkets, etc.</p>
</blockquote><p>In Ecuador I have a strong feeling masking continues to be popular because of the pollution here. There are no emissions standards and certainly no catalytic converters.</p>

IDK) Since kids in the USA were banned from schools because of their HIV status, it's pretty obvious that the fear of residual virus from saliva would be a major problem to a restaurant. Reminds me of my sister. First time she and her new husband had the in-laws over, after dinner she put the dinner plates on the floor, one by one, and their dog licked them off after which she put them back into the cupboard. The point is it's not what happens after you use the plate that is disturbing, but what happened before. (BTW, the in-laws expressions were, it was reported, hilarious - but they said nothing.)</p>

The chance that anything happens to you worse than theft in 90% of foreign countries is extremely small. Russia was getting over 8 million foreign visitors including 300,000 Americans annually before COVID shut international travel down, even if a handful are held as hostages, the odds that it’ll be you are essentially zero especially if you’re a nobody and don’t break any laws (including drug laws) that might give them pretext. The main things to worry about are things that could potentially shut down the entire country, like I probably wouldn’t travel to Lebanon right now. But risks to you as an individual are almost not worth considering when traveling. The State Department travel recs are basically like the CDC telling people to eat only well-done steak.</p>
<p>Even perceptions of safety are going to be more informed by media preconceptions than things actually happening to you. I remember my first time going to Mexico which I thought was going to be super-dangerous and ended up doing a bunch of precautions that had locals saying “es seguro” to me and made me just feel like a jerk; of course nothing happened to me.</p>
<p>I’m glad there are at least a lot of travel influencers now who can go to places and show people it’s not so bad.</p>
</blockquote><p>Locals telling you that everything is safe is nationalism on parade in LATAM. It's okay to complain about crime but only to a point.</p>

Bukelele (much like Milei) is one of the most transformational political figures of this century. </p>
<p>The reason the Western elite opinion is against him is that he nakedly and single-handedly exposed the lies our elites tell us. He proved that crime and disorder are not inevitable consequences of modern urban life in the West particularly in America like we are told. </p>
<p>One of my childhood memories is in the mid-2000s watching CNN (yes they aired CNN on Indian cable TV for some reason; stolen signal maybe) and seeing some guy on a panel say plainly "locking up criminals won't reduce crime". Even at that age when I didn't even know what a liberal or any idea about American politics other than Bush was the POTUS, I remember it struck me as one of the most illogical and dishonest things I've ever heard. I remember thinking obviously locking up criminals will reduce crime. How could it possibly not? </p>
<p>Yet, how many times have liberals in the West told us that locking up criminals won't work? One of the most stunning lies a political movement has ever told. Liberals have allowed criminals to victimize us and run roughshod over our neighborhoods for decades. </p>
<p>Yet, Bukele, a single man oversaw the most successful reduction in murder rates in any nation in perhaps the history of mankind by precisely doing that -- simply locking up criminals. Not “exploring the root causes of crime”, not “systemic racism”. Just lock up criminals and it transforms your society overnight.</p>
<p>P.S. I'm willing to concede that some due process violations have occurred at the margin. But the vast overwhelming majority of the incarcerated are obviously guilty.</p>

<p>If I give Naveen some credit here, it's that people in the liberal West have generally been skeptical that harsh measures can be sustainable to stop phenomena - as we saw applied to Covid for example. But to further the Covid analogy, why be China when you can be Taiwan and get 99% of the benefits in lives saved without the same level of authoritarian social restrictions?</p>
<p>Maybe if you're El Salvador such harsh measures are required, but developed countries are pretty safe (variations by country obviously going from Japan-&gt;USA or something like this), have been getting safer, and a lot of the remaining crime is like some man kills his wife after too many beers or something like this, and that's hard to eliminate on the margin where the same tools are not available as homicide caused by organized crime. Not without compromises that affect the liberty of non-criminals, like banning booze.</p>
</blockquote><p>The true LATAM response to violent crime is to say that it only affects those involved in narco operations. That's mostly true with some exceptions for mistaken identity and collateral damage from an assassination.</p>

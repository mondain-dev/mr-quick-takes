<p>Is Germany truly more committed to bilateral trade with China than the United States is? To the degree the US has ended "<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimerica" rel="nofollow ugc">Chimerica</a>", it has mainly started engaging in an expensive programme of tariffs and subsidies to practice import substitution, that will increase its deficits. May not be sustainable.</p>
<p>OECD estimates that productivity for Germany relative to the US in 2022 was <a href="https://data-explorer.oecd.org/vis?tm=gdp%20per%20hour&amp;pg=0&amp;snb=10&amp;vw=tb&amp;df[ds]=dsDisseminateFinalDMZ&amp;df[id]=DSD_PDB%40DF_PDB_LV&amp;df[ag]=OECD.SDD.TPS&amp;df[vs]=1.0&amp;pd=1970%2C&amp;dq=.A.HRSPOP%2BGPGDHR......&amp;ly[rw]=REF_AREA&amp;ly[cl]=TIME_PERIOD&amp;to[TIME_PERIOD]=false" rel="nofollow ugc">99%</a> of the US level and that real PPP GDP productivity growth per hour worked was actually the same for 2023 for US, UK, Germany (<a href="https://oecdstatistics.blog/2024/03/05/labour-productivity-amidst-global-uncertainties-insights-from-2022-23/ " rel="nofollow ugc">Figure 3. Labour productivity growth in 2023, experimental estimate</a>), with Germany performing more strongly than the rest of the Eurozone (Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Netherlands). The "Germany is finished" horse has bolted out of the pen, but can it really get far without getting tired?</p>
<p>Is Germany a warning example of consensus politics? Well, Italy's outcomes show that noisy politics may not work very well either.</p>

Since most aren't filtered in any way, Democrats will have plenty of future voters living on welfare.  This "makes sense" as far as the rules of the game are  set, but it's extremely anti-democratic.</p>
</blockquote><p>The problem is that most people are idiots and don't have the processing power to realize that democracy in and of itself is pointless when your overlords are able to manipulate the electorate at will, if not the elections themselves.</p>
<p>That's how you can have the propaganda outlets in the media and pseudo-intellectual Outer Party rearguards like Tyler talk about whether democracy is at stake and the midwits in the MR commentariat immediately jump to Orange Man instead of considering whether democracy got taken out behind the woodshed a few decades ago when our overlords decided to elect a new people.</p>
<p>This is why democracy itself was a bad idea. Most people are not fit to manage their own affairs, much less make sound decisions on the future of a country with an eleventy-trillion dollar budget and hundreds of millions of residents. It would be fine if we were entirely composed of people with a homogeneous background and a common vision, but we're not, thus we are led by sociopaths who hate us.</p>

<p>As the paper puts it: "<i>Subtype 3, which followed an unhealthy ‘high protein and low fiber dietary pattern’, had lower well-being scores than other subtypes. ... Individuals, such as in subtype 3, who exhibit a higher intake of fatty meat may experience elevated stress levels and a higher risk of mental disorders, as reported in previous studies on the relationship between diet, stress and mental health</i>"</p>
<p>Fit with my feeling that people with a too much meat (pig meat, cow meat, chicken meat) sort of vibe tend to be people who are reliant on stimulation, low self-control, high levels of impatience, and on average maybe have more self-regulation problems.</p>
<p>"Balanced diet", omnivorous, seems to do best (although maybe the healthy diet subgroup improved after controls for genes or something?).</p>

<p>But for 99% of people, the only view they'll see of a building is from the outside, not the inside.  Even for the wealthy, they'll only see the outside view for 99% of buildings.  Nor is there anything preventing otherwise traditionally styled buildings from having more expansive windows using modern technology.  Lastly, the idea that traditionally styled buildings are meh inside is questionable.  Here's a local <a href="https://pixels.com/featured/university-of-michigan-law-library-matt-russell.html" rel="nofollow ugc">example</a>.</p>
</blockquote><p>Also is that a great example of:</p>
<p>a) the need for windows to enhance lighting (no longer req)<br />
b) a building with lots of structure that doesn't generate useful space (bcz the need for large high windows)<br />
c) a building that likely has ridiculous modern heating costs<br />
d)  ?? and was kept at a lower temperature for this reason when it was built?? (e.g, heating was more expensive then, and people were used to colder buildings)</p>
<p>e) maybe the most important: a building constructed whent the state didn't already have 3/4 of its revenue committed to social programs that didn't exist then.</p>

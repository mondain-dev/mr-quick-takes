And I won't forget the Brits who spied on their citizens this week<br />

</blockquote><p>I am surprised at several of the figures.  In fact, I am sure that some of the figures are just plain wrong.  I have been to Egypt and there is no way that  39.9% of the population speak fluent English.  More like 3.9%.  Similarly, many of the other figures seem odd.  I think we can safely ignore this list.</p>

One list of the most cited philosophers."</p>
<p>They looked only at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.  So this is not really a list of "the most cited philosophers" as Tyler claims, instead it's a measure of the interests or prejudices of the editors of that Stanford encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Which could be interesting if one is interested in what those editors think.  But I think the standard more wide-ranging weighted citation indices are more useful and interesting.</p>
<p>This study doesn't have to tackle the tricky problem of weighting, because they can treat all citations as equal within an encyclopedia.  But that's a heavy tradeoff; they're looking at a very narrow universe of citations.</p>

And the promise of resurrection and eternal bliss. Cancer has killed my closest relatives and friends, young and old alike. I'm not sure which is worse: dying by cancer when young and before a long life of suffering or dying by cancer when old after a lifetime of suffering, cancer such a cruel way to end one's long journey through this life. Are the lucky ones those who die young? I recently lost a life-long friend, whose positivity belied a lifetime of suffering, suffering as a child when he nearly burned to death, suffering as a young adult and for the remainder of his life after getting hepatitis from eating shell fish and permanent liver damage, suffering through a long battle with a blood cancer through conventional and unconventional therapy that zapped his strength, and the final insult the brain cancer that killed him. And through it all he was the johnny appleseed who sought out the suffering to spread his good cheer and never-ending positivity. But to Tabarrok it's the FDA's fault, if only the FDA allowed drug makers the freedom to choose, then no more suffering. Sometimes I think that Tabarrok is a pod person, an original A.I. I suffer emotionally from the loss throughout my life of so many close relatives and friends from the scourge of cancer. The FDA didn't cause it and the FDA can't fix it. Suffering are us. The very idea that suffering can be cured is preposterous.</p>
</blockquote><p>Forget the resurrection and eternal bliss. Even experiencing that for trillions of years has to be fatiguing.</p>

If we did that, I feel like people would be way more promiscuous than they already are, and would be much less picky about their sex partners and practices. I think our sex drives are so powerful that we need a powerful counterbalancing force like disgust to keep it in check. If not for disgust, I feel like we would see an explosion, not only things that our society may no longer frown upon--such as bi- and homosexuality and polyamory--but also in things like incest, pedophilia, bestiality, scat, etc. I wouldn't want those things to become more common. Even though too much prudishness is bad, I think the complete absence of prudishness is just as bad.</p>

<p>It's an interesting choice and as he states at the start of every episode, it's his interview and he'll ask the questions he wants, so no problem.</p>
<p>But human conversation is a highly evolved, silky thing, and trying to reroute it is going to grind some gears.</p>
<p>And interpreting conversation through a lens of "well that's just lower value signaling and I'm seeking higher plane truth" - that's quite a hubris filter to pass through. </p>
<p>It's one of the great daily failures here, the belief that there's always one superior answer, and only malignantly wrong alternatives.  It's good election posturing, and bad for governance and nearly everything else.</p>
<p>To his credit, Tyler doesn't flog this view quite as extensively as others, and I think has at least a benevolent view towards lesser mortals.</p>

There’s no chance Tyler’s going to get him off the rails. In fact, Bloom is so much in control of the conversation, that in the end, it’s Tyler goes off the rails, delivering the confessional rant about hating it when his guests signal empathy. I can picture Bloom leaning back and smiling with satisfaction. Bloom claims that being a psychologist gives him no advantage in manipulating other people, but he seems to be working the controls in this CWT.</p>

If we did that, I feel like people would be way more promiscuous than they already are, and would be much less picky about their sex partners and practices. I think our sex drives are so powerful that we need a powerful counterbalancing force like disgust to keep it in check. If not for disgust, I feel like we would see an explosion, not only things that our society may no longer frown upon--such as bi- and homosexuality and polyamory--but also in things like incest, pedophilia, bestiality, scat, etc. I wouldn't want those things to become more common. Even though too much prudishness is bad, I think the complete absence of prudishness is just as bad.</p>
</blockquote><p>In an excellent episode, I thought the example of immigration as disgust was weak. I wish Tyler had asked Mr. Bloom about late-term abortion. One can be ok with abortions up to a moderate time, and strongly against late abortions, including right up to the moment of delivery. That opinion may be fueled largely by disgust at killing a fetus that would likely survive.</p>

William James &amp; "Dick" Neisser are their "gods;" but, the Father of Psychology is Wilhelm Wundt [1859]--for mostly political reasons, Wundt, a German, is barely mentioned any longer--not even in many History of Psychology textbooks ... it is all tragic, though somewhat amusing, also ... Paul Bloom is a perpetrator of this scam ... Psychology, for the most part is no longer a Science, though, some practitioners are fighting back by way of the emerging field, Machine Psychology [AI, "machine learning," "reinforcement learning"] ...</p>

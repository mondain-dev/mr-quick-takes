Not sure there's any need to over-analyze what that's all about.</p>

How much of this is really about immigration? Isn’t it more about politics and conservative politicians need for an “other”? After all, if we wanted to stop illegal immigration all we’d have to do is require e-verify and prosecute employers who were found not using it. But Republicans won’t do this. They have too many constituencies who rely on migrant labor. And punishing employers is not satisfying to Republicans. </p>
<p>There was a good article, IIRC in the Texas Monthly, a month or few ago pointing out that no one in Texas is actually against immigration. If they consider any serious move against immigration the agribusiness and construction lobbyists start calling. So Abbott and company do anti immigrant theatre while not actually moving against immigration. Expect pretty much the same from Trump.</p>

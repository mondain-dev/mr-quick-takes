Bargains: “Connecticut’s only home with an FAA-approved private paved airstrip is selling for $2.9 million.”'</p>
<p>This brings up the question of what does a private airstrip need to do to be approved by the FAA.  (And what flight operations can it carry out if it lacks FAA approval?  Presumably I can fly a drone from my driveway, but carrying paying passengers would entail a much higher level of regulatory scrutiny.  But what about non-paying passengers that I give a ride to on my Cessna?)</p>
<p>The FAA website has the answers, but it'd be too exhausting to hunt down the answer:<br />
https://www.faa.gov/airports/airport_safety/part139_cert</p>
<p>One summer I worked as a lowly office assistant for a regional FAA office, mainly doing filing and routine typing of forms.  That office had about ten engineers who  were always out in the field somewhere, and would return with a folder of stuff that I'd file away, usually the  folder was about a VASI or RIL at a small general aviation airport.</p>
<p>My job was so lowly that I didn't need to know what a VASI or a RIL is so I didn't ask.  Years and years later it occurred to me to wonder and I saw that these are Vertical Approach Slope Indicators, and Runway Indicator Lights.  The FAA engineers were designing where to put the VASI and RIL devices at those airports.</p>
<p>From the photos, it appears that this Connecticut airstrip lacks those.  So presumably that airstrip cannot be used in certain kinds of weather (or darkness), or by certain kinds of planes, or by planes doing certain kinds of business (flying paid passengers).  That's my guess anyway.</p>
<p>I don't even see a wind sock in the photos?</p>

Does coddling the “unhoused” have to take precedence over the rest of us citizens and our ability to enjoy public restrooms, parks, libraries, and sidewalks? Just round them all up and take them to facilities to treat drug and mental health problems that are located outside of these expensive cities and in cheaper areas where they can be run more cost-effectively. And leave the expensive city streets to responsible citizens who don’t use public restrooms to shoot up drugs or get blowjobs from trans hookers and just want to relieve their full bladders, aim inside the rim, flush afterwards and wash their hands before going on their merry way.</p>

Way down here near my new home there are two "air ranches": each a residential development for very large homes on large lots (small ranches) with a long airstrip (for large jets) and a hangar in the back yard. John Travolta lives in one of the air ranches. At last count, he has seven jets including a Bombardier Challenger 601, Boeing 727, Eclipse 500, Dassault Falcon 900, and three Gulfstream jets. No, he can't fly all of them at once. There is no commercial air service in the immediate area partly because the wealthy people who live in the area, and there are many of them, don't fly commercial. These folks don't horse around.</p>

There are at least two of them in my area. They are probably less common in CT. I'm not sure how much being 30 minutes by air from NYC is useful. Bristol is about a 2 hour drive, and that gets you into Manhattan. Odds are you'd have to fly into Teterboro or some place like that, an hour out of the city.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are people born with avgas in their blood. I remember one issue of Flying where the couple lived in a runway community and had a glass wall between their living room and their hanger because they never got tired of looking at their airplane.</p>

<p>I do not think that unintelligent life can randomly spread at interstellar scale. Intelligent and technologically advanced life is likely to spread purposefully. At high enough level of technological advancement, the only truly scarce resource in energy. So advanced life is likely to seek massive energy sources - black holes, neutron stars etc. Neither our star system not neighboring star systems have anything of value to advanced civilizations. And we do not have ability to see what is going on farther that that. We do not even know how many planets are there in the nearest star system.</p>
<p>To me the whole Fermi paradox seems to have a simple resolution. We are not advanced enough to see what is going on around us. Asking "Where is everybody" is like having a bunch of ants who explored 30-meter radius around their anthill and believe they are the only advanced species in their world because they have not found anything except plants and worms.</p>
<p>"...then we should be colonized by previous generations of intelligence. But we haven’t ...". </p>
<p>You mean "we have not been wiped out". Which is why we can think these thoughts right now.</p>

<p>Studies of the productivity growth differential find that it's mainly about skills shortages.</p>
<p>But how can that be when the UK has a well developed education sector and a relatively free market in wages?</p>
<p>My guess is that it's UK culture. Since the '80s when the old union and mass employment model was discredited, people over here have come to prefer the idea that you study what you want (or don't study at all), and then you "blag" your way into a good job by speaking cleverly and being willing to self-promote and chattering away like an African Grey Parrot. You get in, and then you muddle-along and fake it until you make it. It's a "Have a go" culture.</p>
<p>Actually having the skills and planning a career is seen as something to replace with less expensive labour from abroad.</p>
<p>I think we're seeing the consequences of that, post-2008, when business started to become more careful with paying money to people who talk a good game. The imposters are getting found out.</p>
<p>I don't know though - maybe it would be the same in the US, but business confidence is so much higher that the whole thing can just keep going.</p>

Even highly skilled engineers, accounts, etc can expect to be laid off, underpaid, etc and need to find new gigs several times across their career, so they have to get quite good at "branding and selling themselves'" (though the parrots are often of the New World variety). Might as well hustle your way into Sales and Marketing and skip the serious training if those are the skills you need anyway.</p>

NIMBY has a big impact on infrastructure. </p>
<p>UK can be world leader in wind energy, but NIMBY rural voters protested onshore wind and the Tories caved, like they do every time. Ditto nuclear.  I'd rate NIMBY higher than 25% combined, it affects everything - houses, industry, energy, etc. </p>
<p>A lot of UK housing related NIMBYism is driven by British fetish for investment in property, it's viewed as store of wealth over investing in stocks and companies. The tax system allows unlimited exemption for capital gains on primary home (not capped like in US) and the Planning system allows existing homeowners a de facto veto on new builds near them. They view home = pension, and any new home = competition, and protest anything and everything. Every new floor, extension, build up is protested. My neighbourhood association protested a 2 floor addition (+6 flats) next to tube station because "it can be seen and is therefore detrimental to the character of the area".</p>
<p>A few infra examples..</p>
<p>A data centre next to the highway near Heathrow was denied permission to build because it would be obscure view of grass fields from bridges over the highway. Yes, that was the reason given.</p>
<p>A 14 mile road and tunnel east of London has been in planning process over 7 years, 359,000 pages of planning applications, £800m spent, and cost ballooned to £9bn due to NIMBY objections.</p>
<p>High Speed 2 rail line North of Birmingham cancelled due to ballooning costs. Why? NIMBYs along the London-Birmingham leg complained they didn't want to see rail tracks, so miles of track are being buried because of a few dog walkers complained. Tunnelling costs a lot more.</p>

While the percentage going to the EU had a small increase its likely total goods exports fell. From the paper... "Goods trade started to decline in 2018, falling into the negative in 2019. While Brexit and the implementation of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement in 2021 are unlikely to be the sole cause of those declines, they do appear to have played an adverse role."</p>
<p>It is interesting that services exports have increased. Suggests Appy P may have a point about services. </p>

<p>My point is that too much pf the discussion around low productivity growth SINCE 2008 is blamed on Brexit as the albatross. But the data for exports does not support it.<br />
There may have been some issues between 2016 and 2020 with lower FDI due to political uncertainty, but that was not Abby's point, or Tyler's.</p>

</blockquote><p>"Because the AI is purely derivative of those history books? (and less reliable things)"</p>
<p>This is the confusion here, I'd say.  It's not that the AI has "digested" the books and is trying to repeat them to you.  It's predicting things to say based on texts, but it has not idea how those texts connect to the world (and can't have such an idea, as it has not idea of the "world" - it's all just texts.)  So, it's not something that has absorbed and is summing up a lot of books (like, say, an extremely well read person would be.)  It's making stuff up based on patterns.  Sometimes those are "right" and sometimes not, but not because it has any idea of truth or the like.  That means you should never expect it to be right.</p>

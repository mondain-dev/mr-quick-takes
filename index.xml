<p>But I don't really see how it can be such a factor explain a lower trend growth specifically after about 2006. It's very "Just So", and there's a reason why it's little invoked in academic analyses of the productivity trend.</p>
<p>If you even believe these stories about how planning permission makes everything impossible relative to a zoning system. Back when World Bank used to publish a <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IC.WRH.DURS?locations=1W-GB-US-JP-FR-DE" rel="nofollow ugc"><br />
Time required to build a warehouse (days)</a> metric as part of their Ease of Doing Business project, they found that UK had a similar time to USA. The burden of planning permission regulations between countries are not so easily comparable to estimate their impact.</p>
<p>Alternatively OECD gives a measure of Land Governance Regulation within housing policy toolkit (see <a href="https://www.oecd.org/housing/policy-toolkit/country-snapshots/housing-policy-united-kingdom.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc">here</a> for UK). And while the UK is high on this, it has little relationship with housing costs - <a href="https://i.imgur.com/bOL1zu9.png" rel="nofollow ugc">graph</a> - with countries such as Canada and Ireland with high costs scoring low on their index.</p>

<p>That culture today increasingly means that much of the younger generation default to a negative attitude towards growth and of course much of the older generation don't want any change. Meaning everything in the middle slows becuase there is not enough positive energy.</p>

I'd add that in general, we should downgrade individual people's political beliefs significantly in our assessments of them. Unless you're an academic or policy/politics professional, the amount you actually know is close to nil. Random people's views have near zero impact on the world. And they usually have at least one batshit political position that doesn't make sense. Just ignore all of it.</p>
<p>Much more important is how they deal with people interpersonally. How do they treat  or talk about their parents, siblings, friends, and the waitress or barista on your date? How do they treat you? How do they use their time and what's important to them? These things are usually not too related to politics, and also make a real difference in a relationship.</p>

<p>You shortchange Tyler by implying that his value lies in his ability to parrot the talking points of his predecessors.

As a fellow autodidact, I really feel a struggle in Hughes to assert his own voice rather than to put out a pastiche or tapestry of the voices of others in order to connect.  Hughes' vocabulary and mien were all focused (he might say monomaniacally) on matching and mirroring Tyler's.  I used to do that. Mohammed Ali's line was float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. But Ali had a firm voice, and his miming was an overlay and a strategy, not the main thing. Hughes is floating so nothing hits him directly. And his own convos podcast, conceptually, just doubles down on the matching and mirroring thing.  On the other hand, the Tyler convo with Haidt shows another possibility in convos that I very much doubt Hughes is ready to show.  In my mid-thirties, a therapist changed my life when he said my own habits of miming and mirroring were dangerous long term.  I hope Hughes sees that someday too and starts to assert his own voice politically. Doing so might move him further from a Beastie Boy, closer to an Eminem.</p>

<p>The problem is that those that have said this before are gone. It's important to have a person able to go onto The View and discuss these things so that a new batch of housewives can get the exposure. Sadly, in the last 10 years we've gone from treating everyone the same to giving those with a certain hair type a big advantage at every phase of life. From college admission to jobs. And the 20-something thinks this is a good thing. They have zero understanding this was precisely what Jim Crow was. Because people like MLK aren't around to go on The View and talk about this. </p>
<p>I just re-watched Milton Friedman on Phil Donohue from 1979. What an excellent interview (he was on twice). TC probably isn't saying anything new either. But he can go out and channel Friedman on some topics. And that's important. And Friedman wasn't new either. "I, Pencil" was written by someone I don't remember. But Friedman took and and used it as a very effective teaching tool.</p>
<p>Nothing is new. It's all about having a stable of folks that can channel these messages to the masses.</p>

Have they been enough to reach replacement? Clearly not, but that is one hell of an ask in our world today. Context is very important.</p>
<p>In 2011, TFR in Hungary was 1.23. In 2023 it was 1.50.</p>
<p>For South Korea, TFR was 1.24 in 2011. In 2023 it was 0.72.<br />
For Poland, TFR was 1.33 in 2011. In 2023, it was 1.18.<br />
For Turkey, TFR was 2.13 in 2011. In 2023, it was 1.51.<br />
For China, TFR was 1.67 in 2011. In 2023, in was 1.02.<br />
For Chile, TFR was 1.82 in 2011. In 2023, it was 1.15.<br />
For Argentina, TFR was 2.34 in 2011. In 2023, it was 1.35.<br />
For the USA, TFR was 1.89 in 2011. In 2023, it was 1.62.<br />
So Hungary is performing a lot better than it might otherwise.<br />
(Latest TFR stats are from @BirthGauge on X, an account whose entire MO is tracking fertility from the latest government reports worldwide. Whereas sources like WorldBank and the UN tend to be several-years-old data).</p>
<p>So Hungary made some decent headway swimming upstream while the rest of the world was carried swiftly downstream to the edge of the waterfall! That's something, right?</p>
<p>The fertility collapse problem is just gnarly and any progress in a world where most countries are in birth rate free fall are a very big deal! (As for 5% of the budget, it's a lot but I wouldn't think twice about spending 5% of my income if I had a genuinely life-threatening condition.)</p>
<p>Hungary also loses large numbers of young people, especially of the ambitious sort, to out-migration elsewhere in the EU, so the raw number of births will take a big hit from that factor.</p>
<p>Has Hungary's program been a success? I would say yes, with a qualification:<br />
Culture (especially things like religiosity) matter more, and the broader global culture is clearly quite anti-natal at the moment. Religion is arguably much bigger influence than tax policy and there has been no religious revival in Hungary.</p>

Like, why not do away with summer break so that kids with the IQ to do college can start college at age 15 or 14 or whenever? And why have summer break in college, instead of 3 semesters a year? and why 8 semesters for college instead of 6? Why do law degrees take 3 years, when most of the lawyers I know said that they had learned everything they needed to know pass the bar in the first year of law school? Granted, delayed marriage due to capstone marriages hasn't been a problem for industrialized societies before now. But it seems like one obvious thing that would help is to change the way educations, careers, housing, etc. work so that people can achieve those capstones earlier in life and hence get married and start having kids earlier in life.</p>

People who truly have got the brains and work ethic for university are ready for it by age 16, and three years is long enough to know enough and to be prepared enough to begin apprenticeship phase of a lot of white collar careers. And law school could be condensed into a year, and medical school perhaps could be shortened in the US, just as it is in a lot of EU countries.</p>

Those knobs look perfect for wrapping thread around, so if the holes are for measuring fingers, then that lines up nicely. Except if that were the case, wouldn't we probably see more of them with wear, and might we not also see less precious versions? I feel like it still would have still been beneficial to keep using a damaged one instead of melting it down, to avoid the expense and time loss of getting it reforged, or maybe to try making a replacement out of wood or something. It would be a bit weird if a useful tool only existed in lightly used deluxe collector's editions, you know what I mean? I guess my intuition on how many cheap tools survive more than a millennium might be overly optimistic, but still, it seems odd to me.</p>
<p>If we imagine the tools also had some kind of wealth signaling value or religious function which outweighed any practical utility, then the lack of cheap and/or damaged versions is easier to explain, but then again "religious and/or status symbol" is the traditional fallback for anything archaeologists can't explain, so it's a little disappointing to have to default to that.</p>
<p>I don't really have any better answers though. Dungeons &amp; Dragons keeps coming to my mind. Were Roman nerds sitting in the basement of their mom's villa, pretending to be elves and hoping for a natural 20, just like me in the 21st century? Probably not, but it's an amusing mental image, and nobody has yet disproven it.</p>

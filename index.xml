The US is unique in having the pick of the world’s most ambitious and qualified people. Israel and Taiwan are geopolitically unique.

<p>From a European perspective it seems odd not to confront the mix of indigenous demographic collapse and massively increased mobility from highly populous Middle Eastern and North African countries. The French elections strongly imply an enormous political backlash. Muslims are also organising as a political bloc in the UK General Election.

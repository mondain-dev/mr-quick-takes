</blockquote><p>If i'm not mistaken, this also excludes military payroll.</p>

The closest earlier snapshot before that is August 24th 2023 when she did have them (https://web.archive.org/web/20230824071321/https://twitter.com/AOC). So she removed them probably over half a year ago. Any claim that this is because of the election is false.</p>

As a techno tourist, I've been to clubs around the world and no city compares to Berlin (maybe Tbilisi, but much smaller). Berlin has the network of extremely talented DJs, producers, labels, and of course clubs. Even more importantly, there is a deep culture of how to go night clubbing. In most of the world, one stops clubbing at 25, but in Berlin, clubbing is centered around people 25 and up. It's a refreshing scene that is truly based around the music. Every club is different. Berghain being the best and most intense, but Renate (closing) being like one giant house party, Watergate (closing) a very high quality local club with an amazing outside section, Griessmuehle (closed), Bar25 (closed), OHM (currently open) my personal favorite with lots of local artists. The clubs closing is representative of a lot, too much to say in one comment. But the biggest thing is the fact that Germany and Berlin is getting older. Old people don't care about the spaces that younger people need to socialize, they just see the problems, noise, drugs, etc. So more and more noise ordinances get passed making it harder to run clubs, leading to their closure, leading to more isolation from young people who just get lost in their phones now. Second, Berlin is rapidly gentrifying. The world is flattening, and it's hyper competitive, Berlin is a poor artist city, with a very chill vibe and after the pandemic TikTok made it known to everyone that the world's chillest and cheapest place is Berlin, so everyone started to move. With the leftist government generally refusing to build housing, the rents have exploded, making it very hard to find an apartment. But if the government did make more housing, more clubs would close because of land prices and noise complaints. It's a perfect storm for downfall of Berlin nightlife. And don't get me started on how phones ruined clubbing for Gen-Z. All that being said, I've been to Berlin 7 times since 2019, I've had the best (and worst) nightlife experiences of my life there, but this NYE I'm going one last time and staying for 2 weeks to say goodbye to my beloved Berlin. Other cities have good clubs, but nothing will ever come close to Berlin. If you have experienced it in your life, consider yourself lucky, because the party is over.</p>

<p>I may personally agree with Alex on how to evaluate FDA Commissioners but Alex seems to presume that Trump would agree with him, too.</p>

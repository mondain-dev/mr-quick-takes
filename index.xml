<p>IMO this is the problem with raising taxes in the US: evernyone knows we *would not* get the money back in sensible services and investments that generally benefit the broader population; the government in power would simply steer the money to whatever "investment" their religious zeal is for at the moment (and which enhances the wealth of their constituents), however worthless that would be in the long run.</p>
<p>In that sense Scott Sumner is right: the US has become a banana republic, with the government seeking to return favors to its benefactors, not to benefit the general population.</p>

I don't want to get sucked into that rabbit hole, but there's a problem there that I'm not sure either SA or RH appreciate: medical interventions are a "becoming" not a "being". That is, they're not static. What I mean is that an intervention is context sensitive. Not only does the training of the medical team matter, but the number of cases (training set?) matters too. I'd rather have a mediocre brain surgeon at a 1st rate neurosurgery center (who does several of the procedures a week) than a star surgeon at a small rural hospital (who does a maybe handful of the surgeries per yr). That is, training, practice, and infrastructure/support all matter in distinguishing between  "good" and "bad" medicine, and all of those thins are dynamic - changing continually. Good luck trying to distinguish between the "good" and the "bad"- except retrospectively. (Although, there are certainly good ways to assign the probability of a good/bad outcome, given the particular context. Those ways may not be legal, given HIPAA.)</p>

I've little doubt that if you asked them the right questions they'd say that's why they do it, but I also seriously doubt anyone actually sat down and said "I'm going to build a cathedral because that'll get me X rewards in the afterlife." They do it because it's what you do in this culture. </p>
<p>Most groups in the past had a performative element, which is done for its own sake. Things that simply aren't questioned. Diet is a great place to look for this--why don't we eat goat routinely in the USA? Because it's not done. Outside of diet, though, we in the USA live in an incredibly utilitarian society, and tend to view any performative aspect as either an evil to be culled, or as not REALLY performative, they're doing it because of X, Y, and Z value they think they're getting from it. It leads to a lot of errors when assessing other cultures.</p>

And that's just the supply side. I don't see any shortage of demand for low-skilled work: we can do with more automatic cleaners so we can have more gardeners, cashiers so we can have more shop advisors, automated taxis so we can have more barristas, and machine peeled potatoes so we can have more real chefs. So-so AI innovation is fine by me. If anything I am worried that the abundance of low skilled workers is one of the reasons productivity is not growing fast enough. People surely know that one of the theories as to why the industrial revolution started in England, not France, was their shortage of manual labor. That's the positive side. On the normative side, I understand that it is a pitiful state of affairs if young people, willing to build a more prosperous future for themselves, are barred from leaving their dysfunctional states. One can make the argument that facilitating immigration for these young and ambitious people is a moral imperative (it often fails on the practicalities when people insist on awarding identical benefits to the newcomers). But this is a two-way street: perhaps we can also do more to export good governance to countries that are currently incapable of governing themselves and tie this to mutually beneficial free-trade agreement. Quite possibly, the European refugee crisis could have been prevented had Europe agreed to expand its existing free-trade agreement with Turkey to also cover services and public procurement and offered tax incentives for Western companies to settle in designated economic zones near refugee camps.</p>

I don't think he argues that "we" - aka society - should be telling management what to do with AI.  More like we should remove the artificial barriers to labor.</p>
<p>OTOH, he has not considered that we have artificial barriers to utilizing the labor we have here already - we call them "entitlements".  Some aren't even specified as such, for example as I pointed out below, people are now entitled to the right to squat on public land, so they no longer need an income to afford drugs and a place to live.</p>

<p>I wouldn't count on legacy cash being phased out in 10 years, though. See my comment above about some jurisdictions - typically deep blue areas - enacting laws that require retail businesses to accept cash.</p>
<p>And these laws are typically fairly recent. The LA City Council passed its ordinance in late 2023, for example.</p>
<p>The rationale to date has typically been progressive arguments about the unbanked, and stats on racial/ethnic/income composition of that group.</p>
<p>Wouldn't surprise me, though, if similar laws at some point get traction in red areas due to some combo of Dave Ramsey finance types, "I don't want to be tracked" libertarian-ish views, and the increasing suspicion of big business among Republicans.</p>

<p>I don't get how you figure that.  There are thousands of "workers" smoking dope in homeless camps doing SFA.  In the mean time, who knows how many *high paying* jobs are being killed by the relentless march of regulation - such as, in Seattle you're not allowed to build a house on your property bigger than adjacent homes - even though many many people want to do that - wealthy people who would hire skilled tradesman to do the work.  </p>
<p>Meantime, while dope is proliferating throughout society there is a massive shortage of drivers - in part because if you've even been busted for even a small toke, you have no chance in hell of driving a commercial vehicle.  </p>
<p>And, of course, there is the $20 min wage for unskilled workers, which is obviously putting a crimp on demand.</p>
<p>We're in the middle of the Democrats' Great Leap Forward.   Wait until their engery policies take effect.  Then you'll see a huge jump in demand for labor.  (not)</p>

The Act defines “artificial intelligence models” as machine-based systems that can make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments and which can formulate options for information or action. However, the Act does not emphasize AI models generally – rather, it focuses specifically on AI models that it defines as a “covered AI model.” These covered models are those that meet one or both of the following requirements: (1) the model was trained using a quantity of computing power greater than 10^26 integer or floating-point operations or (2) the model has similar performance to that of a state-of-the-art foundation model."</p>
<p>"Safety assessment requirement: Under the Act, developers would be required to assess safety before training a “covered AI model,” ensuring that the models are safe and do not pose a risk to public safety or welfare. This involves making a positive safety determination that the model does not have the capability to enable certain harms, such as the creation of chemical or biological weapons that would result in mass casualties or a cyberattack on critical infrastructure resulting in $500 million or more in damage."</p>
<p>"Third-party model testing: Developers of covered AI models are required to implement a written safety and security protocol which provides sufficient detail for third parties to test the safety of the models they develop."</p>
<p>"Shutdown capability: Under the Act, developers are required to implement a shutdown capability for AI models when such models have not obtained a positive safety determination. This means that developers must be able to deactivate or restrict the AI model's functionalities until they are able to obtain such a determination."</p>
<p>That's from a summary of SB-1047 prepared by the international firm DLA Piper. As one can see, the proposed Act isn't nearly as broad as the alarmists are indicating. What's going on here is the industry, having grown accustomed to its immunity from liability pursuant to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, recoiling from an effort to prevent the industry from evading liability for damages caused by a limited number of A.I. systems. Indeed, the Act proposed in California is limited, distinguishing A.I. systems that have the capability to enable the kind of harm the Act covers. The "nefarious" actor scenario described in the blog post is a red herring.</p>

I wouldn't worry so much about documentation; open-source communities are surprisingly capable there.  The bigger issue is whether any of the CA requirements are inconsistent with the typical open-source licenses (e.g., require a warrantee against harm) and/or the LLAMA license.  Even a minor change can be a huge PITA in open-source land due to the distributed copyright ownership.</p>

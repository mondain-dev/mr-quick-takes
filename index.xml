<p>The modern definition of "Capitalism" is more or less "Anything about economics that I don't like". Things like slavery, economic inequality, the requirement that people work for other people, and the like--all issues that existed for literally thousands of years before Capitalism became a thing--have been blamed on Capitalism merely because some versions, at some points in time, have included these economic elements. Worse, things like health insurance being tied to your job--which is the direct result of government interference with economics in a decided non-capitalistic wartime effort--are also blamed on Capitalism. And if you allow the definition to wander at all, these sorts of accusations will creep in. </p>
<p>If you define "Capitalism" as "Everything about economics I don't like, and nothing about economics that I do", of course it seems indefensible. You've engineered your definition to BE indefensible! </p>
<p>Capitalism is the idea of free enterprise, that people who own goods and services should be allowed to trade with other people who own goods and services. Often this system is modified by governmental actions intended to protect various parties, but fundamentally Capitalism is merely another name for free enterprise--or, in other words, the recognition of property rights. As such, realistically what this question is saying is "Is private property defensible?" </p>
<p>For my part, I've lost a significant amount of respect for Tyler for even participating in a debate with such a title. Anyone who would ask this question is not honest, and engaging in a debate with such a person is indefensible.</p>

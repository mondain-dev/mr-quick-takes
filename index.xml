I do miss seeing the pictures of young relatives in the formative years, but all the drama and stupid politics wasn't worth it.</p>
<p>I think Jordan Peterson also said he was happier when he wasn't using social media.  Maybe he pays someone to post stuff for him?  Maybe he doesn't even use it...</p>

Because you are a loser who gets depressed because no one likes your posts. That's really it. The people who hate Facebook are losers. Of which you are one. If I were you I would seriously wonder what point there is to be any longer.</p>
</blockquote><p>You, on the other hand, seem really well adjusted.</p>

Most ads are fine. Most people are fine with seeing ads. But some ads are annoying, and some are downright awful. And some people absolutely detest ads.</p>
<p>Also, there's likely some endogeneity here. They are recruiting from the set of Facebook users who use the site despite ads. It should not be surprising that they aren't very bothered by ads. The set is a self-selected group to begin with.</p>

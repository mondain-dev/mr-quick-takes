</blockquote><p>I find that "essay" non only misjudged, but also dangerous. It's the kind of message that promotes conformism on steroids - sure, let's all apply to Ivy League and then get a job at McKinsey, what can go wrong?</p>
<p>I tell you what can go wrong. I was at Accenture too, and I was a top performer there, to the point I convinced myself I deserved better. Got an MBA, pivoted to finance, and managed to get an offer as trader at a top investment bank. At my new employer, I soon found myself at the bottom quartile, and got fired in one of those redundancies rounds that Wall Street goes through every couple years.</p>
<p>I reckon it took me 5-7 years to put my career back on some decent footing. Once I factor in the cost of an MBA, the lost compensation, the emotional impact of getting fire - I still wonder whether it was worth it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately most people lack the potential for being a tech founder or a successful trader. I appreciate that's not the target readership of MR, which I'm sure includes many accomplished people. But the candid advice I wish I got in my early 20s is that performance is always relative. So yes, choose your status hierarchy wisely.</p>

<p>Everything I've read of hers has been excellent. The themes stay pretty consistent (Canadian rural life, conflicts between smart free thinkers and less smart people).</p>
</blockquote><p>For those who have not read Munro, I would say start with "The Lives of Girls and Women" or "The Bear Came over the Mountain".  Even "Lives" is not a pure novel, but also a collection of short stories, but they have overlapping characters, so they hang together a bit.  I have recommended them to male friends who want to understand girls and women better.<br />
About half of Alice's 160 or so short stories were published in the New Yorker, and when she won the nobel price, "Bear" was the one they republished to celebrate.<br />
She is truly great.</p>

If you share that view maybe this essay has some value, but I find the idea dubious. Anyone who starts from the assumption "Your culture is wrong and I'm going to teach you how to behave properly" should properly be told to go sit at the kiddy table. (And as an aside, can you imagine the backlash if a man had written such an infantilizing article about teaching his girlfriends to eat properly?) </p>
<p>Further, why do people consider capsaicin to be such an important flavor? I can't imagine a similar article based on cinnamon or clove, much less the cult that spicy food has! What I've found is that such people, far from having superior or refined pallets, typically can't appreciate subtlety or nuance in flavor. When you have one flavor that's so dominant there's no possibility of tasting, much less appreciating, anything else--it's like trying to enjoy a candle-lit meal outside, at noon, in June. </p>
<p>This explains the contempt the author has for German food. I've had a fair amount of it (well, Austrian, but emphatically Germanic), and it's got a lot going for it. It has rich, deep, complex flavors. They allow the food itself to shine, rather than using it as a vehicle for some minor component. This allows the tremendous variance inherent in agricultural products to make each meal a unique experience, each region with its own culinary fingerprint. (This is particularly true of the beer and wine--I know geologists who have studied the effects of local geology on beverage production.) But if all you're interested in is that one single chemical, yeah, you're going to be disappointed. The problem isn't the cuisine, however--anything with a history that stretches back so far that it predates written records obviously has something going for it. The problem is you. ("You" being "the person who has a problem with the cuisine".) </p>
<p>If you're ever in Tehachapi, CA, there's a little German place that's open from about 6 am until they run out of food that I strongly recommend going to. That they ran out of food every time I visited the city is an indication of how good the cuisine is. </p>
<p>If you like spicy food, fair enough. I'm honestly glad you found something to enjoy. But your masochism does not mean that my enjoyment of subtlety and purity of ingredients is somehow wrong. And I find the continuous attempts to belittle those of us who prefer to taste what we're eating to be obnoxious in the extreme.</p>
</blockquote><p>Not germane to German food, but I like the taste of carrots; they don't have to taste of coriander and honey</p>

Even the British got hip to Indian food while the Germans are still in the trenches. Boring. And I say that as someone who travels to Austria and Germany each summer.</p>
</blockquote><p>"Here's the deal, if you don't like spicy food your missing out on at least 2/3rds of the world's cuisine."</p>
<p>I've not found that to be the case. I've eaten everything from Norwegian dishes to African to Thai to Aztec (substituting pork for human in that one stew) to Sumerian (I have weird friends), and I've not found that my dislike of capsaicin restricts my enjoyment of those cuisines any more the normal distribution of dislikes would. I've found my shellfish allergy to be a greater restriction on what cuisine I can enjoy than my dislike for capsaicin. (I dislike the term "spicy" because there are a tremendous number of spices other than peppers, and I dabble in ancient cuisine, where "spicy" often meant "containing spices".) </p>
<p>Take Indian food. My wife loves it, so we eat a fair amount of it. (I'm ambivalent about it; it's neither something I seek out, nor something I avoid.) There are a few dishes that I don't like because of the amount of capsaicin, but not nearly 2/3. Maybe 3-4 dishes at a good Indian place (more at a bad one, because idiots think "Indian" means "painful"). Turns out there's a tremendous variety of dishes in one of the most populace nations on the planet, many of which allow the flavors of the actual ingredients to shine through. </p>
<p>And as mkt42 said, if you go to a mid-range or above Indian place they've got options. Capsaicin is a spice, and once you get past the buffets most places will adjust the dish to suit the customer's taste. Some dishes require peppers and the like, sure, just like some require yogurt or shellfish or peanuts, and someone who doesn't like a main ingredient is barred from enjoying those dishes. But given the enormous variety of Indian food, this really isn't much of a restriction. </p>
<p>It's worth noting that you're demonstrating the sort of condescending attitude that I was talking about. "Germans are still in the trenches". They're not. The fact that other people like capsaicin does not mean that those who don't are wrong or inferior. It's a matter of taste, no different from how some people enjoy lavender or cilantro while others do not. And I would argue that if your entire culinary world is limited to one flavor, you're the one who's missing out on the vast majority of the world's cuisine, not me.</p>

<p>It is always interesting to see how many Americans are completely unaware of how extensively American agricultural markets are subsidized and protected, and how there is absolutely no way that any national level politician will commit political suicide by talking about dismantling all the barriers and grants and subsidized insurance and tax breaks in the interest of free trade.</p>

</blockquote><p>There used to be a satirical political party in Canada called the Rhinoceros Party. As part of their official platform, they promised to invade Belgium if elected, because the Belgian cartoon character Tintin once shot a rhino. However, they said they would call off the invasion if the Belgian embassy delivered a case of mussles and Belgian beer to party headquarters. Apparently, the embassy did this.</p>

Moreover, "labor share" of income includes the compensation paid to CEOs and others with income significantly higher than the compensation paid to the average worker. Indeed, it even includes the income realized by Elon Musk and other executives with non-qualified stock options upon the exercise of those options (such income measured by the difference between the value of the stock upon exercise of the options and the option price for the stock), but it does not include the increase in the value of the stock after exercise of the options. Given the popularity of compensating highly paid executives with non-qualified stock options and the rise of stock prices, "labor share" is skewed to the upper level of compensation. Finally, and most significantly for "workers" at the lower end of compensation, the fluctuations (i.e., decline) in investment in "productive capital" here in the U.S. has greatly affected labor productivity and, hence, their compensation. while not significantly affecting the compensation of executives whose compensation is determined in large part by "profits" (including profits earned overseas) and the rise in stock prices. Thus, "labor share" isn't the best gauge for determining  the "relative" condition of workers (relative to capital share).</p>
</blockquote><p>Recall the fun with Elon several years ago when he needed to exercise soon-to-lapse stock options. He announced his intentions to exercise the stock options and took a poll (on Twitter) asking his millions of fans if he should sell some of his Tesla stock to exercise the options. It wasn't clear if reaaly cared what his fans think or if he was simply manipulating the price of Tesla stock: on the one hand, he wanted the price to fall before he exercised the options so his income on exercise of the options (and his income tax liability) would be lower, but on the other hand, a falling stock price would require his to sell more shares to pay the option price. The man is smarter than the average bear, and I assume he hit the sweet spot of a rising and falling stock price (whatever he considered the sweet spot). This episode involved billions, not some paltry sum that might be paid to "labor" even though his income on the exercises was included in "labor share". My point of this specific is the same as my point of the general, "labor share" (or labour share" if you prefer) is an ambiguous term.</p>

<p>Obvious examples are big tech, big pharma, and so on.  But I think it's even true for consumer products companies.  Anybody can make a cola that tastes reasonable, but really only 2 companies compete in the cola/diet cola market in the US.  If you want Oreo, Pop-Tarts, WD-40, or a Weber grill, you don't have a lot of choices.  And the owners of those brands capture the higher margins and pass them on to shareholders.</p>
</blockquote><p>This is mostly advertising and branding init?  All of the brands you mention are relentless advertisers.  Another brand in this category recently stumbled badly in its marketing and lost a good share of it's sales: budweiser.  </p>
<p>Another reason all these brands are competing only in twos and threes is that they don't actually make that much money because their core businesses are growing slowly if at all.  Cola and beer, for sure, are on the outs these days in the US and Europe, although they are growing in international markets.  Same with cookies and pop tarts.  And WD-40 isn't much use on your computer.  </p>
<p>I'm sure if Tyler wanted to introduce a delicious Cowen Cola he could bring it up to speed with Coke and Pepsi with sufficient investment.  But with the market for cola plateauing, he wouldn't make very much money.</p>

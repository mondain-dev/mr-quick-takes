Economists have been writing about it for ages. In traditional prediction markets, the bet is made by lending money, contracting for future delivery or buying a share of an enterprise. </p>
<p>What is called a prediction market here is basically old fashioned book making. One is betting on being correct in one's prediction, not in simply getting one's money back with interest, a supply of some commodity at a fixed price or a share of a more valuable enterprise.</p>
<p>People bet on predictions all the time. You can bet on horse races, elections, football games, and probably anything else. This appeals to gamblers, but gamblers want to get their rush in a timely manner. It only works when one is betting maybe a few weeks out, but ideally less.</p>

[...] They also have no military whatsoever.<br />
These sound like reasons for Americans be unhappy with German politics, not for Germans to be unhappy with German politics.  Selling to China work out great for 25 years.  Losing a cash cow may be painful, but that doesn't mean you'd be better off never having the cow to begin with.</p>

<p>If such a person had a third of the voters behind him, it would be an obvious threat to American democracy. That half of the voters currently support him mean that overestimating the risk is not possible.</p>
<p>Maybe you could talk to a couple of Federalists or Heritage Foundation sources, because they are not shy in private at discussing their ambitions to use that dictator for a day to further their goals, regardless of the will of the voters.</p>
<p>For myself, any time a political figure talks about rounding up millions of people and receives massive support from half the electorate, the warning light is flashing bright red. Democratic nation rarely indulge in mass detention under a leader who proclaims to be a dictator on day one.  </p>
<p>Did Cowen mention eurogeddon when talking about Germany? Or is that the sort of thing he prefers buried, since that prediction did not bear any fruit.</p>

Since most aren't filtered in any way, Democrats will have plenty of future voters living on welfare.  This "makes sense" as far as the rules of the game are  set, but it's extremely anti-democratic.</p>
</blockquote><p>The problem is that most people are idiots and don't have the processing power to realize that democracy in and of itself is pointless when your overlords are able to manipulate the electorate at will, if not the elections themselves.</p>
<p>That's how you can have the propaganda outlets in the media and pseudo-intellectual Outer Party rearguards like Tyler talk about whether democracy is at stake and the midwits in the MR commentariat immediately jump to Orange Man instead of considering whether democracy got taken out behind the woodshed a few decades ago when our overlords decided to elect a new people.</p>
<p>This is why democracy itself was a bad idea. Most people are not fit to manage their own affairs, much less make sound decisions on the future of a country with an eleventy-trillion dollar budget and hundreds of millions of residents. It would be fine if we were entirely composed of people with a homogeneous background and a common vision, but we're not, thus we are led by sociopaths who hate us.</p>

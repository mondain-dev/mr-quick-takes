Most ads are fine. Most people are fine with seeing ads. But some ads are annoying, and some are downright awful. And some people absolutely detest ads.</p>
<p>Also, there's likely some endogeneity here. They are recruiting from the set of Facebook users who use the site despite ads. It should not be surprising that they aren't very bothered by ads. The set is a self-selected group to begin with.</p>

Besides murder, there’s another crime that is almost universally reported, car theft, because of insurance claims. If you look at car theft and use that as a proxy for crime/disorder generally, current crime rates are comparable to the 1960s and much lower than the 1970s-90s: https://counciloncj.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/motor-vehicle-theft-factsheet-2.pdf. This seems more plausible to me; I wasn’t around in the 60s but most of urban America seems obviously much safer than it was in the 90s; there has been massive amounts of gentrification and many neighborhoods that people did not go into back then have tolerable levels of crime today.</p>
</blockquote><p>This suffers the same problem as Murder as a proxy for overall crime, namely that cars are much more difficult to steal now than they were in the past. A car in the 1960s or 70s had the mechanical security of a key, and that's about it, along with ignition systems that could be bypassed easily with simple tools. Today's cars have sophisticated anti-theft systems. Keyless entry, GPS tracking, immobilizers, electronic key FOBs, Alarm systems, Cameras, and better physical locks.   </p>
<p>As a case to prove the point, when a flaw in the anti-theft system of Many Kia models became widely known, making theft possible with simple tools, theft claims on impacted Kias went up 1000% in 3 years.</p>

There is indeed a general trend where in the USA we write highly specific rules designed to prevent the last crisis from happening again, whereas in the EU they write principle-based rules. One advantage of the EU system is that it makes it harder for regulated entities to find and exploit loopholes in the law: the regulator can deem anything a violation of principles. A disadvantage of the EU system is that it creates regulatory uncertainty, though as I understand it regulated entities will often chit-chat with their government regulator ahead of a decision to ensure what they want to do falls within the principles as the regulator sees them. In the USA, there is often an adversarial relationship between regulatory agency and regulated entity and they prefer not to talk to us.</p>
<p>The first term of Barrack Obama was a time of great optimism and idealism when many US government agencies had leaders who had little previous government experience and had big dreams of changing government. At my agency, we had a guy who wanted to explore a move to principles-based regulation. We informally asked the companies we regulated what they thought of this and they were terrified. They told us that they in way wanted this: what they wanted was safe harbors and certainty. They wanted to read a rule and have their lawyers say with certainty that a given approach would or would not violate those rules. That was the end of that experiment.</p>

<p>Three models:<br />
I. CWT has some sort of affirmative action thing for women going on. Considering Tyler’s views on implicit bias against female intellectuals, this is perfectly plausible<br />
II. Again, affirmative action but for people Tyler broadly agrees with on political philosophy and shares mood affiliations with. In this case, centrist liberals of a hawkish disposition.<br />
III. Once again, affirmative action but for people who hate Putin, Orban, etc. This is similar to II but not exactly the same. The Tatar guy he hawks (Kamil Galeev, who is going to be on CWT very soon), for example, hates Putin with passion but seems much obviously less committed to the sort of rule-from-Brussels technocracy that excites people in the previous category. Hating Putin does not automatically make you a good liberal.<br />
IV. Tyler Cowen met her and they are on friendly terms for some reason or another.</p>

His successor, VP Ford, who became president when Nixon resigned in disgrace (although not for the wage and price controls), took a different approach, imploring fellow Americans to WIN (Whip Inflation Now), which in time became associated with Ford's timidity (he was a mid-westerner) and reputation for ineptitude (Pres Johnson alleged that Ford, when in the House, couldn't fart and chew gum at the same time). WIN was a loser, but Ford did pardon Nixon to end that nation's "long nightmare" (i.e., Nixon's presidency). As for inflation, later (1980s) Paul Volcker, Chair of the Fed, did something indeed, 18% interest rates, that tamed inflation, got Reagan the "strong dollar" Reagan wanted (in part to finance massive deficits), and conferred on Volcker a reputation as a dragon slayer. Not sure about dragon slayer, but what Volcker (together with Reagan) accomplished, besides the contractionary effect of 18% interest rates, was to clear the path for the China Miracle, for which he hasn't been given the credit he richly deserves. Maybe Binder will set the record straight in her new book. As for Ford's challenges with chewing gum, his reputation as inept was attributable to walking and falling, not farting and chewing: he repeatedly fell down stairs, which continues to serve as a metaphor for presidential ineptness at fighting inflation and should be covered in Binder's book. .</p>

<p>Sounds reasonable and rational but is (also) a bit illustrative for the average academic. Its not that in industry people are impatient (relative to academia) because they are short-sighted or dumb, its because time has an (opportunity) cost in competitive markets and not (so much) in academia. </p>
<p>I am sure that in industry people sometimes cut too many corners, however making things too complicated and too convoluted has its own costs.</p>

<p>In all seriousness, the irony here is that this Tweet is supposed to be directed at a certain liberal or left wing subset of academia, but it equally applies to academics like Tyler who are wasting their entire waking lives on social media dancing like monkeys for engagement in like minded bubbles.</p>

Claims about social resilience (NYT)."</p>
<p>This brings to mind a couple of concepts.  </p>
<p>Though Taleb is more of a crank than insightful, "anti-fragile" is a good way to summarize the resilient cultures.  The ones that developed anti-fragile infrastructures and mechanisms survived, or at least bounced back faster.</p>
<p>I'd guess that there are analogies here with the evolution of species within given ecological niches?  If the local area stays stable, the local organisms can evolve to maximize their survival and reproduction in that niche; maybe they're the resident orca pods in Puget Sound that specialize in eating salmon, that used to be plentiful there.</p>
<p>Which is great while it lasts, their salmon-eating lifestyles helped them thrive over less-specialized species.</p>
<p>But Puget Sound in the 21st and late 20th century has a lot less salmon (and more pollution and boat traffic) and the local orca population is threatened -- while transient orca pods that wander in and out of Puget Sound, and that do not limit themselves to eating salmon, are doing fine.</p>
<p>In a changing ecological environment, the anti-fragile orca populations are doing better.  In a stable one, the resident population thrived.</p>
<p>The other concept that might be relevant here is the agriculture-versus-hunter-gatherer article that Tyler linked to a couple of weeks ago.  If your region is subject to frequent disruption, you're better off having technologies and lifestyles -- such as agriculture -- that enable you to ride out those tough times.  </p>
<p>With more reliable weather, local game, and local plants, you might instead benefit from the higher average productivity of the hunter-gatherer lifestyle.  But now you're more vulnerable to changes in climate or severe weather or even just seasonality.<br />

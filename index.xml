There is no inherent moral reason to favor your fellow citizens but the state cannot function effectively if the citizens do not feel the state looks out for their interests.</p>
<p>Also, consider countries that are at war or may be soon like Ukraine, Israel or Taiwan. Cosmopolitanism works well enough in a peaceful climate but no one will fight any wars on behalf of these countries if they don't feel part of some common national project. Or, put more concretely, some people in these countries have some reason for feeling they have nowhere else to go. Maybe they don't have foreign language skills, don't have realistic job prospects abroad, or they have family and friend ties that are much too strong to consider leaving. If those people fight like they have their backs up against the wall when trouble breaks out, they will certainly expect certain privileges as citizens when peace is restored.</p>

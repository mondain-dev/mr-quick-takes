<p>I got an internship through my college when I was 20 and had to sign a non-compete with the company. When I graduated there was a recession and the company had no positions available for me to apply to. </p>
<p>The next company (same industry, different products) required me to obtain a waiver from the first company. They at first refused to give me one and claimed it was FOREVER (this was before constraints from lawsuits). I went to my college explaining that their partner companies were preventing me from gaining employment with the degree they had bestowed in an entire industry my internship was for, FOREVER.</p>
<p>While the company did end up writing a release due to the pressure from the college (except for the type of products I worked on and with a 2 year time limit) it was ridiculous in the first place that my job prospects were literally put at risk, the significant time I had to spend and the stress of not knowing the outcome.</p>
<p>I for one am glad to see it die the death it deserves.</p>

He is perfectly dispassionate when discussing war and nuclear annihilation,   but he goes into full confrontation debate mode defending the idea that it's good for children to spend 10 hours a day in a pointless dopamine loop explicitly designed to be addictive.  </p>
<p>It's just such a strange thing to be the one topic to be so passionate about.</p>
<p>I do think he actually has no idea what phone behavior looks like for non-elite kids which explains it a bit.</p>

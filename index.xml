<p>90 percent of the problem with the H1B would be solved if the government charged $50k per person per year for it.</p>
<p>You could even offer to drop the fee after five years and grant a path to citizenship after ten.</p>
<p>SpaceX and Goldman Sachs would be happy because they could get the "price is no object" global talent, visa mills would cease to exist, and an H1B would never be hired because he's cheaper than an American. And the system would be less blatantly unfair to immigrants. And it would pay some of the cost of supporting those immigrants, while ensuring that they're the kind of immigrant likely to cost the least and probably even be above break even on taxes.</p>

How much of this is really about immigration? Isn’t it more about politics and conservative politicians need for an “other”? After all, if we wanted to stop illegal immigration all we’d have to do is require e-verify and prosecute employers who were found not using it. But Republicans won’t do this. They have too many constituencies who rely on migrant labor. And punishing employers is not satisfying to Republicans. </p>
<p>There was a good article, IIRC in the Texas Monthly, a month or few ago pointing out that no one in Texas is actually against immigration. If they consider any serious move against immigration the agribusiness and construction lobbyists start calling. So Abbott and company do anti immigrant theatre while not actually moving against immigration. Expect pretty much the same from Trump.</p>

He is perfectly dispassionate when discussing war and nuclear annihilation,   but he goes into full confrontation debate mode defending the idea that it's good for children to spend 10 hours a day in a pointless dopamine loop explicitly designed to be addictive.  </p>
<p>It's just such a strange thing to be the one topic to be so passionate about.</p>
<p>I do think he actually has no idea what phone behavior looks like for non-elite kids which explains it a bit.</p>

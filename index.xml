Talk is cheap, and as a swing state voter I have to look at records. There is almost always a disconnect between campaigning and governing and as a voter you have to sniff that out. </p>
<p>The fact is that Kamala when in power (senate + tie breaking vote in senate + border czar) has done nothing but endorse and enable leftist policy. How am I supposed to square that now? The "I was just VP" works fine for the last four years (VP's really don't have any power), but she has never explained how her senate stint and 2020 run don't represent her views. One doesn't go from the farthest left senator to being a centrist overnight. How is that going to reflect on her cabinet/admin appointments? Should I expect to see it full of warren-ites like Gary Gensler still?</p>
<p>With Trump however, he's been in office before and has been fairly consistent on the things I care about the most. Kamala may or may not be tough on the border but I know for a fact Trump will. </p>
<p>FWIW I voted Biden in 2020 because I was under the impression he would be more moderate than he turned out being.</p>
</blockquote><p>People like Noah who point to her campaign as proof that she is "moderating" are basically rubes who want to be duped.</p>

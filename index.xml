<p>Yes, femcels exist too. Though they don't get the press that incels do. It's just as sad though. It will inevitably lead to a lonely life and regret in the long run. Sure a chatbot will always say what you want to hear, but that's not healthy. A large part of life is having a partner to share life with. You aren't sharing life with a chatbot. It's no different than living your life in books or TV instead of making human connections.</p>

"[T]o bring people closer to God." Years ago in my church, the  Episcopal Church, and in the Roman Catholic Church, the reformists began a redesign of the interior of the building, moving the altar from the front wall out close to the congregation, the idea being to bring the people closer to God. But does it? </p>
<p>The area around the altar and cross is called the "sanctuary". I suppose the sanctuary was removed from the people when it was at the wall, but when the "sanctuary" was moved out among the people, the "sanctuary" became more like the cashier at Walmart than the sacred place inhabited by God. When the sanctuary was separated, it was a mystical place: one could feel the presence of God in this special, separate space, that only a few could enter. I was an acolyte, so I was allowed in this sacred space, and I felt it. I still do in the churches with the traditional design. I've argued with young priests about this who only know the new design. but when I say that the new design has diminished the sacred place of the sanctuary, as anybody can and does wander around the altar like the cashier at Walmart. Does it matter? For those who have a "personal relationship" with God, I suppose not. Pray tell.</p>

</blockquote><p>Yes, we can burn the US flag, we can burn a cross with jesus on it. We can sexualize Jesus. The other side puts their iconography on a crosswalk. And then dares anyone to drive atop it without reverence. What would happen if you burned a pride flag? If you drew a picture of mohammed and burned that? Or drew a picture of mohammed having gay sex? Jail. That's what.</p>
<p>The ultimate eff-you is forcing one side to accept the desecration of their iconography, while putting them in jail if they don't celebrate yours. </p>
<p>Kids in WA state are looking at up to 10 years for peeling out on their scooters on a pride crosswalk.</p>

</blockquote><p>I think Tyler expects intellectual and media elites (overwhelmingly on the left) to do better and not spread misinformation or embrace outright conspiracies like the bizarre claim that Trump wasn't really shot at. For better or worse he holds them to a higher standard than the Right who tend to downplay or reject intellectualism and the academy already. In general I agree, comes out of CNN, ABC, MSNBC, NPR, Slate, NY Times, The Atlantic, and universities etc is much more important than low level Republican operatives try and push on their own voters.</p>

<p>In fact, they have been actively and demonstrably harmful as this study indicates and none of their positive effects have come to pass.</p>
<p>- De-facto drug legalization in West Coast cities have been a disaster.<br />
- Even drug legalization of marijuana has been a disaster. I witnessed it on ground zero in Denver. Read Charles Fain Lehman's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/magazine/marijuana-legalization-new-york.html" rel="nofollow ugc">excellent NYT piece on what a disaster marijuana legalization has been.</a><br />
- Conservatives are complicit in this but reduced gun control has been shown to causally increase self-harm and suicide rates in many studies. Though gun control reduction has only had a modest or insignificant effect on gun crime.<br />
- Criminal justice reform as implemented by fellow travelers with libertarians on this, the progressives have been a disaster as well (de-policing, eliminating cash bail, reducing sentences for violent crime, making felonies into misdemeanors). Though Alex to his credit has <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/08/still-under-policed-and-over-imprisoned.html" rel="ugc">called for more police</a>. Just look at everywhere from SF, LA, Oakland, and DC to Philadelphia where Soros-funded progressive prosecutors and DAs have taken office (or previously held office).<br />
- Now, legalized gambling is having a significant impact on the financial health of young men as this study shows. Ignore the 0.3% credit score decrease. It’s a devastating study that shows significant effect sizes for other financial harms. </p>
<p>Libertarians keep selling on magical benefits of lifting prohibition on vices but when they are lifted society remembers why these vices were banned in the first place. </p>
<p>Conservatives should govern like conservatives and remember they are not libertarians though their worldviews overlap. Libertarians should listen to this excellent podcast episode by Charles Fain Lehman titled <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-libertarian-case-for-drug-prohibition/" rel="nofollow ugc">The Libertarian Case for Drug Prohibition</a> on the Charles C.W. Cooke podcast.</p>

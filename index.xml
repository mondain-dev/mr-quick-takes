Something about this event seems to have really tickled the left's instincts for mob violence. Violence is bad, m'kay? Unless it involves a corporate CEO and especially one that runs a health insurance company. Then all time for the people to rise up and murder the ruling class in their sleep. </p>
<p>On the other hand, I just got an "explanation of benefits" in the mail telling me, after the fact, that the XRays the doctor ordered for my kid "just in case" aren't going to be covered and they are sticking me with a $1200 bill for a procedure that took all of 10 minutes for a tech to perform at a walk-in lab.  Which sort of made me feel inclined to murder a few people in their sleep. </p>
<p>There is definitely something dysfunctional going on. Providers routinely order procedures without bothering to check if they are covered by insurance. This didn't used to be the case - I recall in the past being told up front if the insurance was going to cover a thing or not. They wouldn't tell me the price, but they would tell me if it was covered. These cays, they don't even bother to check. Bills just randomly arrive in the mail, months after the fact, demanding random amounts of money that nobody informed you you were going to have to pay.</p>

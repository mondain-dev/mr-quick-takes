The most explosive issues of the past few elections have been purchasing power, the price of diesel, the age of retirement and the shortage of housing (often taken by migrants awaiting asylum hearings)."</p>
<p>How crude these luddites are. They worry about such things as the cost of transportation (diesel); housing; food and clothing and medicine and car repairs and insurance (purchasing power); and the uncertainty of old age for those not in the privileged class. What a bunch of crude materialistic deplorables! They should be concerned about climate change, DEI,  and the right of foreigners to overrun their homes and obliterated their culture!</p>
<p>These grubby unsophisticated and ungrateful populist right wingers should be grateful for their privilege!</p>
<p>Definition of populism from the Oxford dictionary: " ... political approach that strives to appeal to ordinary people who feel that their concerns are disregarded by established elite groups"</p>
<p>The elite want to impose their "luxury beliefs" ( see Rob Henderson) on their victims, but the deplorables want none of it.</p>
<p>This is democracy.</p>
<p>Watch it unfold. </p>
<p>A terrible beauty is born.</p>

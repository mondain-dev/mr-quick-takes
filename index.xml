Reminds me a lot of the story of Red Delicious Apples. People bred apples for color rather than taste to the point that one day consumers were like "why are we buying these tasteless apples? I want old fashioned apples that taste good, who cares about color!"<br />
Similarly, the market has been on autopilot making toiler paper softer and softer, assuming that consumers are always going to want an <i>even softer</i> piece of paper to wipe their ass with.<br />
But it's not like ALL the toilet paper brands are doing this. Scott tissues advertises 1000 sheets per roll. Just buy that.</p>

Most of that time people listened to the smartest person in the room. Not any more. Now, people more often listen to the dumbest person in the room. Which brings me to A.I. I have ridiculed A.I. as the latest big thing from tech, to go along with tech's earlier big things like social media. What I have come to realize is that A.I. is tech's atonement for its sins. That's right, humans can't be trusted, especially the humans in tech. But A.I. can be trusted because, like Jesus, A.I. knows no sin. A.I. is righteous! I['m serious. What would A.I. gain by manipulating humans? Profits? Now, that doesn't mean there aren't those who would use A.I. to manipulate, just like some use social media to manipulate (who might that be?). But generative A.I. will learn from its mistakes because there's no profit in mistakes for A.I.</p>

</blockquote><p>Professional athletes are different from the rest of the economy only in that athletics are farther in the direction of a winner-takes-all economy. A small number of people can play professional football, and all of the rewards go to those who can. In our information economy, outsize rewards go to those born with high IQ, but thankfully more people can benefit, and there is no sharp cliff.</p>
<p>Surely work ethic, conscientiousness, social skills, avoiding debilitating vices, etc. matter, but genes are huge. If there were an NFL-sized professional circuit for math competitions for young adults with comparable remuneration and status as the NFL, there's a pretty good chance I would have been in it. Sure, at this point I have a strong work ethic, but the fact that I can produce a great deal for society and be rewarded for it in a market economy is primarily due to genes.</p>

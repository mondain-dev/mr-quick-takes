Thank you. One of the year’s best. </p>
<p>Wildly out of context quote below but it made me laugh out loud:</p>
<p>“If you survived the Stalin collectivization terror, and you wrote a memoir, you looked back on those days in the schoolyard, that Georgian revenge culture, and you said, “Oh, I remember when he was 11, and he put the cat in the microwave. I knew right then that we were all going to die.”</p>

I worked and lived in Europe for a U.S. company as a software developer/manager. I got to know a lot of peers at other companies. The prevailing attitude of European managers toward software developers was that they are glorified typists and they pay accordingly. My direct colleagues were very happy to be able to work for a U.S. company at close to U.S. salaries while still living in Europe. Other developers I knew had the dilemma of moving to the U.S. to make better salaries or staying in Europe. The best of them moved. Obviously good for U.S. productivity and bad for Europe's. But, the point is that this isn't really regulation driven, but cultural.</p>
<p>Patrick McKenzie (patio11) makes the same points about working in Japan.</p>
<p>I should note that managers in the U.S. had the same attitudes back in the 1980s but this gradually changed. Hopefully, it's in the process of changing in Europe.</p>

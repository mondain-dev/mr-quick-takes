<p>1. The Vivek 'Boy Meets World' Post, with its bizarre cultural confusions, the insane assertion that the US would be better off if we all adopted this stupid Tiger Mom student-as-slave mentality, and that this would somehow be a road to national greatness</p>
<p>2. The very real and nuanced H1b debate, which has to contend with the fact that a lot of Big Tech uses H1B labor as exploited indentured labor, people who can be deported if fired from a particular firm, etc.</p>
<p>It also has to contend with the point - made by Laura Loomer of all people - that AI boosters (like Big Tech, and TC himself!) are all telling us that AI is about to be able to do everyone's job, starting in the very first place with the coders jobs! If this is true, why do we desperately need to import millions of coders from India??</p>
<p>Obviously racial abuse is horrifying and should be condemned, but Tyler should also engage with many of the deeper issues here!</p>

<p>90 percent of the problem with the H1B would be solved if the government charged $50k per person per year for it.</p>
<p>You could even offer to drop the fee after five years and grant a path to citizenship after ten.</p>
<p>SpaceX and Goldman Sachs would be happy because they could get the "price is no object" global talent, visa mills would cease to exist, and an H1B would never be hired because he's cheaper than an American. And the system would be less blatantly unfair to immigrants. And it would pay some of the cost of supporting those immigrants, while ensuring that they're the kind of immigrant likely to cost the least and probably even be above break even on taxes.</p>

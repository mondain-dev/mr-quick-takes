Eel vs. octopus (NYT)."</p>
<p>"A 2022 observation recorded in Las Minas Islet, Cantabrian Sea off northwestern Spain, in which the eel lost an eyeball in the battle"</p>
<p>Spain is also where those orcas are attacking sailboats.  Imagine if octopus decided to start attacking human swimmers and divers, choking them and removing their eyeballs.  </p>
<p>Come to think of it, how do fishermen catch octopus?  According to articles on the web, one common technique is similar to catching lobster or crab:  a trap with bait inside, that the octopus enters but can't get out.  Or won't get out, surely an octopus could exit if it wanted to, given their ability to squeeze through tiny cracks.</p>
<p>And in the 1990s Japanese fishermen invented a new type of lure and technique called egi, basically a lure made to look and move like a small fish, inducing the octopus (or squid) to strike and I guess get impaled on the hook.<br />

This thought seems rational but is 100% wrong.  Citizens *should* be thrilled with absolute growth that improves everyone’s standard of living and yet the irrational monkey parts of our brain are so focussed on fairness that being richer in absolute terms but poorer in relative terms makes one feel anger that they have been ripped off.  Internet influencers and billionaires as celebrities are a heavy grit sandpaper that chafes even worse. As a child, my father crapped in an outhouse in the bitter cold of winter and never felt poor because he saw his friends doing the same.  Then came Robin Leach and Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.</p>

You could maintain the same elder care workforce just by moving some workers from other sectors into elder care; if you don’t want immigration, you could try outsourcing jobs that can be outsourced and having your own workforce specialize in ones that can’t be outsourced like elder care.</p>
<p>Additionally, most Asian elders grew up in pretty severe poverty and have relatively low living expectations compared to Americans so won’t require as much care; they don’t have McMansions that need to be maintained by others and don’t need the pensions needed for that.</p>
</blockquote><p>This is boiling frog logic.  You said, "Even if South Korea’s population falls by two-thirds,"  IT ALREADY HAS among the only relevant population, youth.  In 1981, there were 867,410 babies born.  In 2023, about 240,000. Given the TFR now, they'll be under 100,000 in one more generation.  </p>
<p>Your elder care plan better involve 70-year-olds taking care of 90-year-olds.  :) Either way, I'm afraid to inform you that old women can't give birth.  South Korea already pretty much is the Walking Dead.  All those South Korean old men wandering the subways for free all day with no grandchildren, no legacy.  That is South Korea.   And things are getting much, much worse.</p>

I'm not trying to shame it but it seems the opposite of masculine.</p>
</blockquote><p>"I'm not trying to shame it but it seems the opposite of masculine."</p>
<p>I can think of a number of American Broadway-Style Musicals that absolutely are masculine, sometimes on a heroic scale: </p>
<p>Oklahoma (the cowboy is an archetype of masculinity in America, including the singing cowboy)<br />
Paint your Wagon (see above)<br />
West Side Story (gangs are, unfortunately, another archetype of manliness in America)<br />
Camelot (this story was one of several to define masculinity for hundreds of years)<br />
Pirates of Penzance (goofy, but you can't call pirates effeminate)<br />
Phantom of the Opera (the titular character was evil, but not effeminate)<br />
My Fair Lady (a study in contrasting ideas of masculinity from a woman's perspective)<br />
I kinda want to put "Sound of Music" in here as well. It focuses on Maria, but the von Trap family includes some good examples of masculinity in difficult situations. </p>
<p>If you include Disney movies the list grows quite dramatically. For example, "The Lion King" (and, obviously, the play it was based on) can be viewed as a study of masculinity. </p>
<p>In point of fact, in pretty much every culture BUT our current Western culture singing and dancing were things men did regularly. There were entire types of songs that were meant for men to sing together (pub songs, rounds, sea shanties, etc). (There were songs for women to sing together as well, and for mixed company. Turns out singing is a human thing, not a gendered thing.) Dancing and poetry were knightly arts, and you can't get much more manly than the knight in shining armor. This idea was fairly clearly brought into musicals, which are derived from operas (and it was once considered normal for men to go to these things because they enjoyed them). </p>
<p>Bright, showy clothing was also once considered very manly. Clothing was a way to show off wealth, and a man who could wear gaudy clothing (which means: One who could afford to waste resources on dye and imported cloth and the like) was someone very powerful, and thus to be respected. Modern men would be considered absurdly somber and drab in pretty much any other point in history. </p>
<p>You actually remind me a lot of Lancelot in "Camelot". "Knights? Picking FLOWERS?!" Arthur quite rightly chastised him for that bit of stupidity.</p>

"Yet as Shakespeare’s Jessica, Ophelia, and Desdemona (not to mention Cleopatra) demonstrate, this is the opposite of a recent trend: Parents have bestowed the terminal “a” on baby girls for a long time." That was from an article in The Atlantic in 2015. Then there's Rebecca. I recommend to my young male friends not to get involved with a Rebecca; and if Rebecca rides horses, run away as fast as you can. She will break your heart while breaking the bank. The latest of the Rebecca names is Meredith. The name means great ruler. It's part of the trend to give girls names that nobody can spell correctly.</p>

Won't that induce humans to write like GPT? Is that a desirable goal? Will musicians have to compete against GPT in writing music and lyrics? Has anybody, Cowen, thought this through? I recall many decades ago there was a revolt against Strunk and White because, those revolting claimed, clarity destroyed originality. My view at the time was that clarity destroyed deception. I don't believe GPT will provide clarity, it will facilitate deception. Is that clear?</p>
</blockquote><p>Music and language aren't analogous.  Language requires a specific logical structure (aka chomsky's deep grammar) to function at all (aka terrance Deacon).  Balls don't green and long doesn't fly.  In that sense - e.g., training people how to create sentences and paragraphs that have a rational structure - it seems highly probable that GPT or whatever AI can be developed to provide high quality training for writing - probably much better than what the average English teacher can do.</p>
<p>Music, OTOH, while it has various structures that sound nice together for various reasons, has no fixed logical relationship among notes.  Any three notes is a chord; any sequence of notes is music, pleasing or otherwise.</p>

</blockquote><p>Dunno for sure, but having been playing and writing for many years, IMO the challenging part of writing is intellectual while the challenging part of playing is physical.  Maybe AI will be able to observe people's playing technique and make suggestions, but I don't think that's just around the corner.  Sure there are some people for whom the physical part comes relatively easy, but for most people it comes only through relentless practice, and I'm not sure how AI improves that.  </p>
<p>IMO the main role for AI will be to take a piece of music, break it down into and separately record its instrumental parts so they can be manipulated by the player for practice.  Right now this processes done by a person who transcribes all the music slowly and painfully.  </p>
<p>So, for example, today if you go on Ultimate Guitar, most of the songs available for practice are well known pop and rock songs.  One of my favs, Brian Setzer, has virtually no songs, just a few stray cats hits.  However, AI could rectify that in a matter of minutes or hours, transcribing the entire Stray Cats / Setzer Orchestra catalog so I can learn any song - like "this cat on hot tin roof" :)</p>

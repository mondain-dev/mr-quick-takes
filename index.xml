<p>An excerpt from the tweet: "People who have installed solar panels at home will no longer get money for selling power back to the grid. Rules compelling heat pumps be installed will be scrapped.<br />
Four new nuclear power stations will be built, and subsidies on electric cars will be binned "</p>
</blockquote><p>Scrapping rules compelling heat pumps is underrated. Let heat pumps compete with natural gas and watch them die off.  (Although, in Euroland, Nat gas is 5x more expensive than the US - so that may not always be true).</p>
<p>If you live in cold climate in the US, watch for heat pump mandate madness from your locality.  Heat pumps  cannot compete with cheap natural gas.  They are often pimped by unethical contractors in cahoots with local green loons.</p>

Whoever that other country is, it will almost certainly have laxer animal rights laws and laxer environmental laws. So all Australia and NZ will have accomplished is worsening animal rights and increasing carbon emissions. </p>
<p>Now, "Great Reset" conspiracy theorists likely think that AUS/NZ leaders understand all this and this is all just part of some plot to emiserate the west and turn us all into serfs or whatever. But a far more likely - and far more terrifying - possibility is the fact that these politicians do not actually have rational goals and are just chasing good feelings. </p>
<p>If a politician has rational goals, you can at least bargain with them, even if they are corrupt or evil. They can be reasoned with. A politician who is chasing feelings? Not so.</p>
</blockquote><p>I get your point if this was what caused the decline in the New Zealand sheep populations. But as I noted in my other comment, this is actually a story of politicians doing the right thing and getting out of the way of farmers. In 1984, they removed price controls and subsidies and let the market work. Farmers found more profitable activities and many moved away from sheep farming as a result.</p>

Your average person on the street knows nothing about economics, and therefore ends up thinking that rent control makes it easier to afford rent.  They couldn't put themselves in the POV of a landlord for 5 seconds if they tried. The same happens when people in the suburbs pick policies that are supposed to increase value and lower car congestion, as they haven't studied the actual dynamics of it all.</p>
<p>It'd be nice to have an electorate that understood that the policies they want do the opposite of their policy goals, but that's what we've got.</p>
</blockquote><p>Economics is the study of a complex system, like the weather, or an organism. Modeling a complex system in an interpretable way is extremely difficult, maybe impossible, but yet at least when it comes to weather, climate, and medicine most voters agree that meteorology and evidence-based medical science are the most appropriate ways to approach the problem -- highly imperfect, but the best option we have. </p>
<p>This is not the case with economics. It seems like most voters don't trust economists, or economics, at all. Is that unavoidable, because economics is inherently more predictable, or is it something that economics as a profession bears some blame for?</p>

Europe needs to invest much, much more in AI, and uncompetitive countries like Germany need to improve.</p>
<p>This sounds like a German disaster in the making, for example. "In 2023 Germany public debt was 2,835,892 million dollars, has increased 134,722 million since 2022. This amount means that the debt in 2023 reached 63.6% of Germany GDP, a 2.5 percentage point fall from 2022, when it was 66.1% of GDP." That figure includes all public debt, not just federal debt - The basis for this calculation is government debt as defined in the Maastricht Treaty, which is harmonised across the European Union.</p>
<p>America, on the other hand is a true model of dynamism, with its ration of public debt being 120% of GDP.</p>
<p>As for trade statistics, the Germans are doing something very different than America too. They just need to turn the balance of trade plus to a minus to have the bright future that America's future oriented economy enjoys. </p>
<p>Seriously, Germany looks like a total basket case, with a future for the birds.</p>

Or else they've stayed constant.</p>
<p>Unusual versus most dialogue where you might thinking of it as a gap which widens over time since 2000. Maybe we forget how much more concentrated things were in the 1990s and 2000s, in technology sectors, compared to a more globalized era in the 2010s? We don't look so much at the longer trend. I guess the tricky bit is that you can't tell if these are simply exports-imports between European states which would be counted as internal trade within the US, and don't really signify much in "global competitiveness", outside the union, so it's apples to oranges.</p>

GPT-4 context: Tyler Cowen's comment, "Lord Monboddo vindicated," refers to the 18th-century Scottish judge and philosopher James Burnett, Lord Monboddo. Monboddo is known for his controversial ideas about the origins of language and human evolution. One of his theories was that human language developed from animal communication, and he speculated that apes, particularly orangutans, might have the ability to use sophisticated language or at least a complex form of communication.</p>
<p>Monboddo made his assertions about the origins of language and the possible connection between human and ape communication in his work "Of the Origin and Progress of Language." This six-volume series was published between 1773 and 1792.</p>

</blockquote><p>I would assume tthat there are a great many allusions like that in LLM output. Tears and onions are highly correlated, though for completely different reasons. However, the LLM won't realize that, it will just attempt to get the word puzzle pieces to match.</p>

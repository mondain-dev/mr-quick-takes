<p>The report is also laughable in its methodology, even if you think more funding should go outside the social sciences. They just take some words they don't like and define them as "DEI", search for those words in the NSF grants applications, and then declare that research definitionally worthless. The "gender" category for example takes "women" as one of those bad words. So in all the evil "gender DEI" research, &gt;70% of the flagged key words just come from mentioning women. In the "environmental justice" category, more than two thirds of the keywords flagged are "climate change", the most obvious research topic of the whole field.</p>
</blockquote><p>But why did the identified percentage rise from 1% to 27% during the Biden administration, as per the linked tweet from Alex?</p>
<p>The methodology may be flawed, but it was applied in the same way to all the years in question. So there is indeed some trend being detected here, although perhaps not the one being claimed.</p>

You could easily make one of those IQ bell curve memes about the Middle East where the 80 IQ guy is saying "the Middle East is violent because they all hate each other", the 100 IQ guy is on some long ramble about how there is a complex pattern of religious and ethnic identities and alliances and centuries of history that you need to understand to analyze the region properly, and the 180 IQ guy is saying "the Middle East is violent because they all hate each other"</p>

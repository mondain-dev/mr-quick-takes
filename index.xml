So we don't need parity, we just need critical mass (e.g. enough male kindergarten teachers to let other men considering that job to feel a bit more comfortable). Each organization will have to decide whether the costs of maintaining that critical mass (potentially weighing the scales for candidates based on gender, for example, lowering overall quality) outweigh the benefits (retaining attractiveness to a wider group of candidates at all times).</p>

</blockquote><p>This is correct. They mess with physicians too. SometImes they will grant pre-approval for a surgery, I will perform the surgery, then they renig and do not pay me.</p>
<p>They nitpick my operative notes saying I need to insert this or that, which forces me to call them and waste my time justifying the surgery to a random non-surgeon physician who works for the insurance company and has no specialized knowledge about my area.</p>
<p>Eventually, I usually get things approved, but their entire business strategy is to delay, delay, delay and hope I give up. It's unethical and inefficient.</p>

Almost all the videos I've seen have been planes, very obviously so. </p>
<p>I think this is mostly public hysteria by people not used to looking up at the night sky. Likely a few weeks back either a small DOD test or a few amateurs having some fun and flying drones around at night. Then rumors spread and everyone is looking up, claiming everything is a drone. These things then get in people's heads and they run with it, claiming there's no way they could be mistaken, etc. </p>
<p>By the way, this kind of thing has happened in the exact same place before: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morristown_UFO_hoax</p>

Born in the suburbs, you move to the dense city for adventure, mate selection and to establish yourself in a career.<br />
    The birth of children sends you to a less-dense inner ring suburb for kid-friendly neighborhoods and schools.<br />
    As the kids get older and you mature in your career, you start looking at the woodsy, semi-rural areas to enjoy your wealth get away from young people.<br />
  After you retire, you want to contract, so you start looking for something smaller in a denser area closer to the hospitals - often you die first.<br />
    This progression would be most people’s ideal, and where they actually wind up living at various times of their lives would be scattered  around this vector, based on chance, income, and life events.<br />
    So it’s incorrect to simply say, “People prefer the suburbs”. The accurate thing to say is, “People prefer the suburbs at a certain point in their lives.”</p>

<p>This is a classic case of people using words they haven't defined and the discussion gets muddled because different people are using different definitions.</p>
<p>When we talk about people living in "cities" or "urban areas", are we talking about people living in the downtown urban core of big cities? Or are we talking about people living within walking distance of a transit line that can get them downtown and to other places of interest and their community allowing for enough density to make such a transit line viable?</p>
<p>Whether people wind up living literally within the city limits of a certain city is not important because city limits change. Harlem was a semi-rural area until at least the early 19th century and was not incorporated into New York City until right around the time the train line was built. Brooklyn was annexed even later. More than 100 years of "transit oriented development" has since transformed previously suburban and rural areas in what is now New York City it into a very dense urban areas. Isn't this exactly the process urbanists are trying to discuss?</p>

<p>But we do not. Which leads to the conclusion that the constraining factor lies elsewhere. </p>
<p>IMO it is physics and energy.  Imaginary flying cars levitate directly, they do not rely upon aerodynamic lift to become airborne.  Which requires more concentrated energy than is viable with existing technology - and probably never will be available.</p>

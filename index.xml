<p>Like the rest of his twitter / mercatus echo chamber, TC invested in weirdo Vance at the peak of his bubble, going so far as to post a rare sophomoric and defensive political ramble to MR. It hurts to be so publicly embarrassed, but now he's moving past pure emotional defensiveness (although still couldn't help whining a little in his Bloomberg piece).</p>
<p>Now he's back on to more comfortable ground for an economist: retroactively justifying his errors with tortured logic and selective examples. </p>
<p>Whew - all is right with the world again. Hopefully we can get back to thoughtful nuance and escape sad twitter brain here at MR. Underrated: art, travel, music, reading and economics posts.</p>

<p>Yeah, I think there was that stage, and now it's "Oh, yeah, but he's still Trump".</p>
<p>Honestly, I think just the idea that people suddenly cared about deregulation, boosting the birth rate, establishing a new military-industrial complex to fight Chinese - I don't think many people really moved that much on these things.</p>
<p>The twitter-o-sphere is extremely faddish and volatile and can be manipulated relatively easily by the algorithm, and is increasingly so every year over the last 10 years, particularly since it has become more self selecting for people who are interested in it as a political conversation place, and less so as a place to make jokes or share music/whatever. Not representative of a real public.</p>

</blockquote><p>Political scientists already have a concept that explains the "vibe shift":  the thermostatic theory of public opinion (https://www.niskanencenter.org/how-does-the-public-move-right-when-policy-moves-left/), where public opinion shifts in the opposite direction of policy change and the policy preferences of the party in power. When liberals are in power, public opinion shifts right. When conservatives are in power, they shift left.  </p>
<p>It's also the norm that presidential candidates try to present themselves as being lined up with the median voter on valence issues and moderate their policy positions in a few key areas to help win over the median. Here's a nice songify of the Obama and Romney convention speeches to illustrate this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekQSpbwKkdg.</p>
<p>But of course Walz isn't going to emphasize his most progressive policy proposals in MN when democrats had unified control. And of course Harris isn't going to talk up her most progressive policy proposals from her days in San Francisco or even in the Senate!  Just like Romney didn't talk about his liberal policies as governor of MA when he ran for the Republican ticket!  Or how Biden also did his best to present himself as moderate when he ran in 2020.  </p>
<p>I just saw this all as the median voter theorem playing out like it always does. Perhaps TC will reply "of course this is happening, but the median voter has moved to the right on wokeism, AKA the vibe shifted." My response: sure, but again, that's thermostatic public opinion, which has been a documented phenomenon for decades in poli sci, such that it's covered in nearly every intro American politics textbook.</p>

Noah links to a clip from Harris's speech introducing Tim Walz, where the left-leaning crowd is actually cheering U-S-A! U-S-A!.  Not only that, Harris prompts the cheer by extolling American Exceptionalism ("Only in America").</p>
<p>Yes, it's a substance-free line.  That's what a vibe is.  But, it does seem a notable break from the Decade of Wokeness for a Democratic Presidential nominee to talk about American Exceptionalism as a good thing.  Further, if one looks at the whole speech, she describes herself and Tim Walz as "two middle class kids, one a daughter of Oakland, CA,...the other the son of the Nebraska Plains..."  (The line is that Only in America can two such middle class kids make it to the White House.)  Describing herself as a middle class kid with the good fortune to be born in America, where middle class kids like herself (and Walz) have unlimited opportunity, is also quite a departure from the recent past.  Notably, that is quite different, for example, from describing America's Promise as still unfulfilled and that she, as a woman of color, hopes to change that.</p>
</blockquote><p>yeah the democrats have shifted to a more centrist and palatable message. libertarian policy positions like body-autonomy, YIMBYism, drug legalization, and MYODB. </p>
<p>Tyler's original post had like 19 points so some were more provocative than others.</p>

I believe TC is smart for certain values of smart, because he appears to have been a good chess player when young and his interest in the GRE indicates that he may have done well on multiple-choice tests. Plus I'd guess that most people who get PhD's from reputable schools are above average, at least.</p>

</blockquote><p>The sentence "I believe the kids call this 'cope.'" is using modern internet slang to comment on the blog post's argument. Let me break it down:</p>
<p>1. "Cope" is internet slang that originated from the word "coping," as in coping with a difficult situation.</p>
<p>2. In internet culture, especially among younger users, calling something "cope" implies that someone is trying to rationalize or comfort themselves in the face of an unpleasant reality, rather than accepting it.</p>
<p>3. The phrase "I believe the kids call this..." is a common way for older individuals to introduce slang or cultural references associated with younger generations.</p>
<p>In the context of this blog post, the commenter is suggesting that the author's analysis is a form of "cope." They're implying that the author (Tyler Cowen) is rationalizing or trying to comfort himself about political changes he might find uncomfortable, rather than accepting a shift in political dynamics that the commenter believes is occurring.</p>
<p>This comment is likely disagreeing with Cowen's assertion that "the vibes have [not] shifted back at all." The commenter seems to think that Cowen is engaging in wishful thinking or self-comforting analysis, rather than accurately assessing the political landscape.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that this kind of comment is often used dismissively in online discourse, and doesn't necessarily engage with the substance of the argument being made.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​</p>

<p>———</p>
<p>My guesses at the magic, in no order:</p>
<p>1. Scarcity of posts and small community. X is tiring + way too many random people. The community here is closest thing to a digital neighborhood or social club<br />
2. Visitors all largely intelligent and diverse backgrounds, but largely shared core beliefs. No one (jinx) is arguing about capitalism vs communism.</p>
<p>Thesis: the chaos acts as sort of a captcha to filter for people who are resistant to it and can ignore it to focus on substance?</p>
<p>3. The pseudonym mechanism makes you willing to contribute meaningful stuff than something ephemeral like an image board<br />
4. At end of day it’s often entertaining. HN and LW have interesting links but far too stifling and self-righteous conversation IMO.<br />
5.  TC / AT don’t seem desperate for you to comment, and in fact you get the gist it’s a bit of a playful love / hate relationship</p>
<p>———</p>
<p>I’m surprised no one’s made an anonymized-reputation social media. I weigh what Ackman says over a random, but there’s stuff Ackman or Eric Adams etc would only say if they were anon, but we’d never see it</p>
<p>You can solve this by allowing Bill etc to switch to a pseudonymous or one-time identity for a post where:</p>
<p>A) Bill can choose to display a tag that the post is coming from either a verified billionaire or someone with 1M+ followers. Maybe even offer an LLM feature that scrambles writing style to reduce Bill having to worry about dox risk.</p>
<p>B) The algo boosts the posts as if the profile had hundreds of thousands of followers</p>
<p>You could imagine lots of interesting anonymous posts on X from verified senior politicians, people in gov, top corps etc </p>
<p>I am surprised, given his focus on free speech, that Elon hasn’t launched something like this; imagine how many interesting insights we could get.</p>

Twenty years ago, you would see negative campaign adds and they would be stuff like "Republicans want to kill medicare and push granny off a cliff!" which is of course negative, but it's not the argument that a 12 year old would make. </p>
<p>You can see the difference between "You're trying to kill grandma with your medicare cuts!" (Which is a pretty low standard to start with), and "Nyah! Nyah! Your a werido!" Right?</p>

<p>This is yet another junk observational study.</p>
<p>As the original Israeli booster observational study that showed a 95% reduction of covid death demonstrates so well, you cannot remove the confounder of selection bias.  The booster in that study reduced <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2306683" rel="nofollow ugc"><em>non</em>-covid death</a> by 95% too.</p>
<p>Why are vaccine manufacturers not doing new RCTs to prove all these awesome benefits?  They would make headlines.  They could advertise how well they work.  They could raise their plummeting revenues by convincing all the people who refuse to take more of their product that it saves lives in all kinds of very surprising and -- given that it doesn't actually prevent covid -- barely plausible ways.</p>

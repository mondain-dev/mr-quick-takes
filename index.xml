</blockquote><p>…and since I’m on the topic, I’ll add that most churches engage in some sort of work in the community that helps people. Now this is just based on my personal experience, but helping others and being useful and needed is about the best thing a person to do to improve their outlook about themselves as well as make connections with others.</p>
<p>In fact, I’d go so far as to say that the only thing churches get wrong in this area is that they’re so focused on giving/helping that they often forget to receive help from the beneficiaries of their efforts.</p>

She started to read the Bible this year after feeling unfulfilled by years of advice on self-care, staying healthy and pursuing a career. She said she also sought stability as “things just went off the rails a little too quickly” throughout society. “We’re kind of holding on to the edge of the ship, like, we’re not sure what’s happening here.”</p>
<p>-&gt; maybe after all the self-care religion is not deep enough to sustain a human life?</p>
</blockquote><p>Lots of women are into self help. The Bible is cheaper and better and with study groups, you can also make connections.</p>

</blockquote><p>Hasn't Frankfurt been the leading capitalist city in continental Europe for, I dunno, 1000 years?</p>
<p>Shouldn't Frankfurt by now resemble utopia? </p>
<p>It's like how San Francisco has the most billionaires per capita in America and perhaps in the world, yet it's unpleasant to walk its downtown streets. You can make strong arguments that San Francisco isn't quite as bad as everybody says it is, but shouldn't San Francisco during the AI Boom of 2024 instead be awesome?</p>
<p>Don't economists have a concept called "opportunity cost?"</p>

<p>Frankfurt is still the third richest city (by PP) in Germany. It is interesting to hear from a US citizen that this doesnt show in the city center. The most noticeable shift has probably been the increase of the amount of office skyscrapers. Median income is ca €55k which is a bit higher than the US average but far away from the richest US cities. </p>
<p>Frankfurt has always been the most international city in Germany after Berlin. In 2022 47% of inhabitants had a migration background (https://statistik.hessen.de/presse/fast-ein-drittel-der-hessischen-bevoelkerung-mit-einwanderungsgeschichte)</p>
<p>The comment that in the 80s the amount of people on the street with a noticeable migration background would probably have been 5% diverges with the statistics. 20% of Frankfurt inhabitants in the 80s had a migration background with the biggest group being Turkish. Maybe the difference is due to that they were not as present in the city centre as they are now.</p>
<p>Frankfurt does not have the highest crime rate per capita of German cities anymore. This title now belongs to Koblenz (https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/200790/umfrage/gefaehrlichste-staedte-in-deutschland/) Frankfurt still ranks second tand it is something that it has struggled with since a long time.</p>
<p>At the last election (European Parliament) the AFD got 7.7% in Frankfurt. This is far away from the results they achieved in other parts of Germany (Eastern Germany, Ruhrgebiet or Rheinland Pfalz). According to the narrative what is the connection with the rise in right wing voters in Germany? That people from Kaiserslautern or Gelsenkirchen come to visit Frankfurt, see a lot of immigrants and that the city is dirty and then decide to vote AFD to change that?</p>

<p>What's with all the throat clearing? What's with the scare quotes? What's with the "at least" clause? What's with the "potentially"? Most of your readers would simply (at the very least) call them objectionable with no qualification whatsoever. You think you are somehow better than us, Tyler? You sound like a new arrival at a brothel who thinks too highly of herself and refuse to take on sweaty bob as a customer like the rest of us do. Let me break it to you Tyler. You are no better than the rest of us. You are just as much a debased prostitute as all of us. Get used to that soon, start behaving accordingly, and we're all good.</p>

It has great residential neighbourhoods such as Westend (where you can see the most beautiful university campus), Nordend-West, or the hipster Nordend-Ost. If you stay around the commercial centre or the more party areas of Sachsenhausen, you won't cross by local Germans (they will avoid those areas), only the cited immigrants. I was there for four years between 2014 and 2018 and saw a lot of improvements only during this time, especially at Bahnhofsviertel. There is also the new neighbourhood created around the new ECB building. It was a good city to live in, but it takes some time for you to navigate. Due to the finance industry, I also had a great experience with constant new art exhibitions in the Schirn, the MMKs, and around the Museumsufer.</p>
</blockquote><p>I have lived more than 8 years in Frankfurt and definately share this view. Ultimately, Frankfurt has characteristics that resemble more a small village than a large urban area in the sense that there is not necessarily a strong clustering of certain activities per district as in other larger cities (i.e. an area to go out and party, eating out nicely, ...),at least in my impression, as those activites are more spread out across the city. As such, you have to move around more (as e.g. compared to other large German cities such as Hamburg, Koeln, or Muenich), as well as need to pay more attention to where those places are - definately worth to have a good local guide. </p>
<p>Please keep in mind that crime statistics in Frankfurt have always been high given its role as transportation hub, e.g. any crime related to the airport (50 million passengers a year) shows up in the numerator (crime) but not in the denominator (population).  </p>
<p>Overall, I would argue that Frankfurt has a very high quality of life for residents, since i) it has a good level of public transportation infrastructure, including bike lanes, ii) it is quite "small" yet very international (I would be interested in getting to know Tyler's take on the food scene), iii) has a high GDP p.c. (in the German context) and hosts many large companies, funding cultural events, museums, iv) has due to the aforementioned factors a general open-mindedness (i.e. live and let live) that you might miss in other cities, even though they deem themselves as culturally open (try to walk into a normal bar in Berlin with a suit on ...), which makes the city very enjoyable to live in. The cons Tyler mentions are well-known to local resident who normally avoid passing certain areas at certain times of the day.</p>

<p>I don't find that striking at all. Many might be second-generation immigrants born and raised in Germany, naturally developing local accents and behaviors. Or am I missing something here?</p>

<p>The distinction between legal and illegal immigrant, and the type of illegal immigrant, is absolutely fundamental to understand public perceptions of immigration in the US - but this blog, and the type of people who read/comment on it are completely oblivious to that distinction (and likely find it quite gauche).</p>
</blockquote><p>I think Tyler is talking about legal immigrants in Frankfurt.  I thought AfD and much of the anti-immigrant sentiment in Europe is directed towards legal immigrants, particularly Muslim legal immigrants.  In the US, much of the opposition is directed towards Christian immigration, both legal and illegal, across the Southern Border.  Indeed, some people seem completely "oblivious" to distinctions...</p>

<p>I wonder how much we have induced biases on this topic. </p>
<p>I was watching some UK TV yesterday, covering collectively some periods spanning the 1970s up to 1997. According to some measures 1997 was a relative higher point in UK:US GDP PPP parity (around 81%, about the level it would stay until the peak), while back in 1973 or today its about 73% (World Bank Constant 2021 for post 1990, Maddison Project/PWT for back-projection beyond 1990). </p>
<p>But the perception of a change in relative wealth was surprisingly not very salient to me, and much more salient was how cultures had changed or remained constant across the time series. Not that my perceptions were inverse or opposed to the numbers, just it didn't seem obvious to me that the numbers were evident in what I was seeing. (The relative quality of people's clothes, the quality of government services, the quality of the other services and goods they were consuming on screen etc).</p>
<p>So I wonder how much noticing changes can because we can be primed by a statistic to expect a change? </p>
<p>When it was 2019, and Germany had, by the numbers, been on a pretty constant growth convergence upwards towards the United States (Germany 1984 - 73% of US; Germany 2019 - 89% of US; Maddison/PWT and WB 2021 KD), would we have been primed to perceive that Frankfurt was relatively richer?</p>

<p>Is Tyler’s German really good enough to distinguish local accents?  As a fluent German speaker myself I find this statement pretty suspect. Frankfurt is the sort of city where even most native Germans don’t/can’t speak the traditional dialect. Maybe some of the more integrated immigrants have absorbed some local phonetical features but I doubt they sound particularly “Hessisch” to the few remaining old Frankfurters left.</p>

</blockquote><p>Tyler clearly has point and I hate to admit it, displays a good understanding of Germany in this regard. It remains true that the AfD is strongest in the eastern states (i.e. Thüringen, Sachsen, Brandenburg). But dont deceive yourself, even in Hessen there is considerable support if you leave Frankfurt (e.g. AfD is the strongest party in the Wetteraukreis bordering Frankfurt). Anyways, Frankfurt is ripe with MENAPT immigrants that show little to no integrationand, tend to be pretty violent and are living on social benefits. Their unchecked immigration is the main reason for the AfD‘s ascendancy. People are afraid that Germany is turning into a third world shithole where long term Sharia rule will be established. That East Germans are more supportive of the AfD has a simple reason, they are less susceptible  to the propaganda of the state media (Öffentlicher Rundfunk) that either outright denies problems with criminal MENAPT immigrants or frames these problems as far right conspiracy theories. From a US perspective it is probably pretty hard to understand that the main objective of many immigrants that consecutive left wing governments have let in, is to enslave the native population and establish a theocracy.</p>

China is known for engaging in dumping-like behaviour with their exports which is very controversial atm but I doubt Minsk/Russia care too much.</p>
<p>China is the largest manufacturer in the world by a longshot and manufactures more than the USA+EU+Japan+UK combined. The EU and Japan might keep some manufacturing share but USA/UK/CAN/AUS/NZ with their open capital markets will continue to have their share hammered as they import the consequences of Chinese policies due to open capital markets. The USA is particularly screwed as the global reserve currency they basically cannot keep their exports competitive on a global scale.</p>
<p>This is all very worrying from a geopolitical perspective as the Anglosphere is the core linchpin on which the liberal order rests but I doubt the NYC-LDN financial establishment will give up the wealth and privileges running the world's finances give them. And the whole Anglosphere is dealing with housing problems which foreign capital flight has played a large part in creating.</p>
<p>Reading Michael Pettis on this subject is very enlightening, he maps out the issues very well.</p>
</blockquote><p>Since the invasion of Ukraine, Russia's exports of oil to China are up by around half.  Gas is up maybe 50%.  Coal is dramatically up.  All discounted compared to international prices.  So Russia is definitely paying for Chinese imports.</p>

</blockquote><p>Hmmmm... I seem to lack the ability to suss out Tyler's thoughts based on his contribution, the title: "Life in Belarus". </p>
<p>Personally, I'm surprised to hear about the extensive influence of China in Belarus before hearing about it in Moscow. Cold War 2.0 is unfortunately very real, pitting the core CRINKs (China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea) and the illiberal Asian nation-states within their sphere of influence against America and her alliance of Orderly Liberal Meritocracies. The CCP can not be happy about Putin forcing their hand. The Russian execution of Aleksandr Dugin's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics" rel="nofollow ugc"> playbook may not have gone according to plan but Putin is sticking to the strategy:</p>
<blockquote><p>Outside of Ukraine and Georgia, military operations play a relatively minor role except for the military intelligence operations Dugin calls "special military operations". The textbook advocates a sophisticated program of subversion, destabilization, and disinformation spearheaded by the Russian secret services. The operations should be assisted by a tough, hard-headed utilization of Russia's gas, oil, and natural resources to bully and pressure other countries. The book states that "the maximum task [of the future] is the 'Finlandization' of all of Europe".</p></blockquote>
<p>My question is how many anti-<b>MR</b> commenters are CRINK agents vs true-blue neoreactionaries? </p>
<p>May you live in interesting times :-(</a></p>

</blockquote><p>Um... I don't know what has gotten into Tyler. I keep hoping Tyler would write some patriotic blog posts that cheer for America, like the kind I see from Noah Smith, BAP, and others. And my hope keeps getting thwarted. Why? What's the mental hurdle that needs clearing? Can we the MR commentariat helps Tyler clear that? I hate to say it, but I think the root cause is that Tyler has a mistaken elitist notion that to write such content would not be "scholarly" or would be some form of "intellectual prostitution". This I suspect is the chief mental hurdle. It's why Tyler cannot give us Noah or BAP style content, at least not layered in three layers of Straussian irony. To which I say, Tyler, that even if, for the size of argument, you are right, you will get over it, like a new arrival at your local spa place gets over it. We were all shy at one point, totally understandable. What's less understandable is not even making the minimum of effort to clear the mental hurdle and bring your readers the content they demand. Less and less acceptable every single day.</p>

</blockquote><p>Tyler is reporting with disappointment that the US-led efforts to cripple the economies of Russia + Belarus aren't working and those economies are proving more resilient and dynamic than expected. I'm surprised you had the opposite interpretation.</p>
<p>A free trade advocate would say, let the people of Belarus work and trade and enjoy a nice standard of living. The US elites are trying to crush the economies of their geopolitical rivals and that involves blocking peaceful economic trade. Tyler supports crushing the economies of Russia + Belarus, but is less supportive of doing that to China; he opposed sanctions against Chinese cars, for example. Tyler also dishonestly portrays the free trade debate as the wise academic economists versus the idiotic populist right. Instead, it's a bipartisan US foreign policy elite driving anti-free-trade policy, and the public, both on the left and right, are clueless about sanctions and US efforts to crush the economies of geopolitical rivals.</p>

<p>The people who run US government, including Tyler, are overwhelmingly in favor of US-led unipolarity, they are willing to use military force to fight against multipolarity, and they are basically hiding this from the public rather than trying to debate this position publicly.</p>

<p>Yeah, I think there was that stage, and now it's "Oh, yeah, but he's still Trump".</p>
<p>Honestly, I think just the idea that people suddenly cared about deregulation, boosting the birth rate, establishing a new military-industrial complex to fight Chinese - I don't think many people really moved that much on these things.</p>
<p>The twitter-o-sphere is extremely faddish and volatile and can be manipulated relatively easily by the algorithm, and is increasingly so every year over the last 10 years, particularly since it has become more self selecting for people who are interested in it as a political conversation place, and less so as a place to make jokes or share music/whatever. Not representative of a real public.</p>

</blockquote><p>Political scientists already have a concept that explains the "vibe shift":  the thermostatic theory of public opinion (https://www.niskanencenter.org/how-does-the-public-move-right-when-policy-moves-left/), where public opinion shifts in the opposite direction of policy change and the policy preferences of the party in power. When liberals are in power, public opinion shifts right. When conservatives are in power, they shift left.  </p>
<p>It's also the norm that presidential candidates try to present themselves as being lined up with the median voter on valence issues and moderate their policy positions in a few key areas to help win over the median. Here's a nice songify of the Obama and Romney convention speeches to illustrate this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekQSpbwKkdg.</p>
<p>But of course Walz isn't going to emphasize his most progressive policy proposals in MN when democrats had unified control. And of course Harris isn't going to talk up her most progressive policy proposals from her days in San Francisco or even in the Senate!  Just like Romney didn't talk about his liberal policies as governor of MA when he ran for the Republican ticket!  Or how Biden also did his best to present himself as moderate when he ran in 2020.  </p>
<p>I just saw this all as the median voter theorem playing out like it always does. Perhaps TC will reply "of course this is happening, but the median voter has moved to the right on wokeism, AKA the vibe shifted." My response: sure, but again, that's thermostatic public opinion, which has been a documented phenomenon for decades in poli sci, such that it's covered in nearly every intro American politics textbook.</p>

Noah links to a clip from Harris's speech introducing Tim Walz, where the left-leaning crowd is actually cheering U-S-A! U-S-A!.  Not only that, Harris prompts the cheer by extolling American Exceptionalism ("Only in America").</p>
<p>Yes, it's a substance-free line.  That's what a vibe is.  But, it does seem a notable break from the Decade of Wokeness for a Democratic Presidential nominee to talk about American Exceptionalism as a good thing.  Further, if one looks at the whole speech, she describes herself and Tim Walz as "two middle class kids, one a daughter of Oakland, CA,...the other the son of the Nebraska Plains..."  (The line is that Only in America can two such middle class kids make it to the White House.)  Describing herself as a middle class kid with the good fortune to be born in America, where middle class kids like herself (and Walz) have unlimited opportunity, is also quite a departure from the recent past.  Notably, that is quite different, for example, from describing America's Promise as still unfulfilled and that she, as a woman of color, hopes to change that.</p>
</blockquote><p>yeah the democrats have shifted to a more centrist and palatable message. libertarian policy positions like body-autonomy, YIMBYism, drug legalization, and MYODB. </p>
<p>Tyler's original post had like 19 points so some were more provocative than others.</p>

I believe TC is smart for certain values of smart, because he appears to have been a good chess player when young and his interest in the GRE indicates that he may have done well on multiple-choice tests. Plus I'd guess that most people who get PhD's from reputable schools are above average, at least.</p>

</blockquote><p>The sentence "I believe the kids call this 'cope.'" is using modern internet slang to comment on the blog post's argument. Let me break it down:</p>
<p>1. "Cope" is internet slang that originated from the word "coping," as in coping with a difficult situation.</p>
<p>2. In internet culture, especially among younger users, calling something "cope" implies that someone is trying to rationalize or comfort themselves in the face of an unpleasant reality, rather than accepting it.</p>
<p>3. The phrase "I believe the kids call this..." is a common way for older individuals to introduce slang or cultural references associated with younger generations.</p>
<p>In the context of this blog post, the commenter is suggesting that the author's analysis is a form of "cope." They're implying that the author (Tyler Cowen) is rationalizing or trying to comfort himself about political changes he might find uncomfortable, rather than accepting a shift in political dynamics that the commenter believes is occurring.</p>
<p>This comment is likely disagreeing with Cowen's assertion that "the vibes have [not] shifted back at all." The commenter seems to think that Cowen is engaging in wishful thinking or self-comforting analysis, rather than accurately assessing the political landscape.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that this kind of comment is often used dismissively in online discourse, and doesn't necessarily engage with the substance of the argument being made.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​</p>

<p>———</p>
<p>My guesses at the magic, in no order:</p>
<p>1. Scarcity of posts and small community. X is tiring + way too many random people. The community here is closest thing to a digital neighborhood or social club<br />
2. Visitors all largely intelligent and diverse backgrounds, but largely shared core beliefs. No one (jinx) is arguing about capitalism vs communism.</p>
<p>Thesis: the chaos acts as sort of a captcha to filter for people who are resistant to it and can ignore it to focus on substance?</p>
<p>3. The pseudonym mechanism makes you willing to contribute meaningful stuff than something ephemeral like an image board<br />
4. At end of day it’s often entertaining. HN and LW have interesting links but far too stifling and self-righteous conversation IMO.<br />
5.  TC / AT don’t seem desperate for you to comment, and in fact you get the gist it’s a bit of a playful love / hate relationship</p>
<p>———</p>
<p>I’m surprised no one’s made an anonymized-reputation social media. I weigh what Ackman says over a random, but there’s stuff Ackman or Eric Adams etc would only say if they were anon, but we’d never see it</p>
<p>You can solve this by allowing Bill etc to switch to a pseudonymous or one-time identity for a post where:</p>
<p>A) Bill can choose to display a tag that the post is coming from either a verified billionaire or someone with 1M+ followers. Maybe even offer an LLM feature that scrambles writing style to reduce Bill having to worry about dox risk.</p>
<p>B) The algo boosts the posts as if the profile had hundreds of thousands of followers</p>
<p>You could imagine lots of interesting anonymous posts on X from verified senior politicians, people in gov, top corps etc </p>
<p>I am surprised, given his focus on free speech, that Elon hasn’t launched something like this; imagine how many interesting insights we could get.</p>

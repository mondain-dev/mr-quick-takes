<p>Nationwide there are over 31k new EVs on AutoTrader on dealer lots for under $50k. This doesn't cover the large number of lightly used EVs out there available too.</p>
<p>Adoption hasn't slowed because of lack of low-cost options. Adoption has slowed because the charging infrastructure sucks and most people don't want to pay another &gt;$5k in cash right now to retrofit a decent charger to their house.</p>
<p>We've just saturated the Early Adopters, and haven't started into the Early Majority yet. The vehicles that the Innovators and Early Adopters are willing to live with (Spark EV, first gen Leaf) and the compromises (Supercharger, Electrify America, and other ABSOLUTE JOKES) aren't things Early / Late Majority are willing to put up with (hence the used prices)</p>

I’m pretty sure this is just openness to experience being correlated with both 1) creativity/open-mindedness and 2) liberal social and political attitudes. But this schema doesn’t necessarily track perfectly with today’s political stereotypes. For example, works that stick to the liberal party line in the most straightforward way (like Don’t Look Up, Black Panther, the Ghost Busters remakes, etc.) are just as artistically bankrupt as the most sentimental conservative movies. An open mind that’s attracted to complexity and ambiguity in entertainment is probably going to be turned off by the simplistic and polarizing extremes of both the left and the right.</p>
<p>5. Also, when’s the last time that an instrumental song reached the top 10? Or a ballad? Or a song with a guitar solo? Or a saxophone solo? Or any instrumental solo part? Or harmonized vocals? Popular tastes in music change so much over the years, it’s amazing to me when I think back to songs that were huge hits when I was a kid, like “You Light Up My Life” or “Sailing,” which be unimaginable in the context of today’s pop music.</p>

So it only counts songs that hit #1. (If the pattern for all top 100 hits was markedly different though, that would be interesting).</p>
</blockquote><p>A broder metric would be better, I suspect it would also show a declining trend, though of course not going to zero.</p>
<p>My take on underlying reasons:</p>
<p>- Increase in % of hits that are rap songs. Rap doesn't really have covers. (Rap songs do, however, often sample well-known songs. That's essentially rap's version of "covers".)</p>
<p>- Rise of streaming services. The older original songs are now readily available. Indeed, can sometimes cause a bit of confusion when searching for a cover song on Spotify or Apple Music. Particularly if the style of the cover isn't that differentiated from the original.</p>
<p>- Think that prevalence of hit cover songs was heavily influenced by common marketing and promotion strategies from major labels, back when those labels dominated the music scene in a way that they no longer do. It could be a "safe" marketing strategy for a cover to be the 2nd or 3rd single from an album. Ties back to the prior point, as a younger generation sometimes might not even be aware that the song is a cover.</p>

<p>It’s also very easy for me to see how fortunes could be won or lost on an election night, when prices fluctuate wildly as results come in, simply by manipulating the flow of information — exit polls, early election results, and especially recount related information. The way we release and announce election results in the US is already painful and stupid.  Why do anything to make it worse?</p>
<p>Having said that, I consumed content on PredictIt and it made me smarter — it was both a measure of *cough* well-informed opinion, and as a sanity check for my own opinions.  And I certainly enjoyed placing the occasional bet (never on a race I worked). No strong feeling here, I just don’t think the issue is as clear cut as Tyler argues given the specter of insider trading.</p>

<p>Is there an economic defense of ticket scalping? I thought that clubs don't like it (and seek to prevent it) because it reduces their share of the profit on ticket sales, and punters don't like it because they'd rather for whatever price x the ticket was supplied at, more of the profit went back into the club. There doesn't seem like any economically useful role scalpers play in speculating on the price that they can resell it for.</p>
</blockquote><p>"Is there an economic defense of ticket scalping? "</p>
<p>Is there an argument against it?  How is it different than trading a stock by buying it at a lower price and selling it at a higher price?</p>
<p>As I've pointed out before, I trade in several markets.  I frequently sell to buyers who don't have time or inclination to sit around waiting for every screaming low price offer.  I spend my time doing that and, in effect, they pay me for my trouble when I offer products to them at a higher price - a price that protects the item from people who would otherwise buy it just because it's cheap.  IOW, I sell to people who want it the most for what it is.</p>
<p>It's perfectly legitimate to function as a middleman to channel products to people who want them the most.</p>

<p>This is where the Democrat party is right now.  They're so invested in their quack beliefs - global warming to CRT to housing policy - that they'll do anything to foist them on the public.  They're simply *completely disinterested* in whether these policies work to the public benefit or otherwise.  In their minds, whatever quack garbage they dream up is immediately a moral imperitive.  </p>
<p>This is why Trump beat Clinton in 2016: lots of people see this.  But Dems are so blinkered to their own quackery that they had to invent Russian interference to explain Trump's victory.  </p>

Why the elite colleges did this is debatable, but maintaining the price they charged for the elite education was certainly part of it. After all, colleges are rated in part by the compensation paid recent graduates. Something similar may repeat, as the news spreads that current graduates either can't get jobs or the compensation is far below both expectations and in relation to the cost of the elite education. My point, besides the spectacle of economists at the same elite colleges preaching to us about the sanctity of markets, is that the "war on prices" is attributable to more than ignorance, and includes the ignorance of history by said preachers.</p>

<p>'specially if you use your $100K law degree to defend the rights of tuna.  Then you really need the free ride that demmies offer to people doing stupid worthless jobs with expensive degrees.</p>

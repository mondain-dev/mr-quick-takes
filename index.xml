Drug addiction, intimate partner violence and single parenthood are all off the charts.<br />
The fact is that on top of russia's terrible demographics the tsar's mad decision to invade Ukraine has either killed off or driven away (probably permanently) a significant portion of breeding age males.<br />
So.... this being russia, the solution is authoritarian with no understanding of human motivations.<br />
Romania tried the same tactic in the 1980s and the results were.... not delightful.</p>

<p>So 70 years of highly Westernized elites trying to destroy traditional Russia and traditional Russian Christian values hasn't worked out so well, has it?</p>
<p>Perhaps the Russians might like to try something else.</p>
<p>They do not have to look to Romania.  Stalin all but banned divorce, abortion and contraception after 1936.  They were gradually allowed back after his death.  </p>
<p>Good for the Russian Parliament.  The West should also reject the culture of death</p>
</blockquote><p>Putin has been working hard over the past 15 years to convince foreigners that Russia is the last bastion of traditional Christian values. Evidently, it is working on some people.</p>
<p>Notably absent is any talk of beating swords into ploughshares.</p>

If you were a single, young heterosexual male, it seems that, all else equal, you would want an environment with more women relative to men.

</blockquote><p>And if I recall correctly, Richard Reeves (who the author throws a lot of shade at) points out that the differences between male and female educational performance begin in elementary school. That might have something to do with masculinity norms, but I think the direction is going from teachers (mostly female) and administrators (increasingly female (41% in 1994, 64% in 2012)) to the students (i.e. educators becoming increasingly hostile to male norms). I don’t think kindergartners are rebelling so as to uphold the patriarchy. </p>
<p>Education (which includes K-12 and university) and education training (schools of education) have become much more female. I don’t know if you’ve noticed but women (especially left-leaning ones) aren’t really that accepting of masculinity norms (positive or negative). Remember, females are much more likely to express negative views toward free speech (not exactly welcoming when someone sees things differently). Is it a) males who are quitting education because they see it as feminine or b) females making it unbearable for males to be there. Having sat on many a committee in my school district, I think there’s a lot of evidence for choice (b).</p>

</blockquote><p>I don't want to generalize too much from comment sections, but I did see this in the comments section:<br />
"User was indefinitely suspended for this comment. Show."</p>
<p>I clicked "show" and this was the comment (responding to another comment about reductions in investment in education): </p>
<p>"The last thing the education system needs is more money. Before they get a dime, they should get of the majority of administrators. Get rid of DEI. Stop pushing political agendas."</p>
<p>Not the most constructive comment, but worth getting indefinitely banned? I dunno. </p>
<p>Saw another "User was indefinitely suspended for this comment. Show" I clicked show, and the following comment was revealed: </p>
<p>"Defunding, as in giving less money, or is the rate of increase of funding just trending lower? It seems that the rate of diminishing returns was passed long ago, and now the returns are actually negative. Universities have been saddled with massive woke bureaucracies and the standards of education have plummeted while being swamped with ideological indoctrination."</p>
<p>The trauma that comment must have caused. /s</p>

<p>The report is also laughable in its methodology, even if you think more funding should go outside the social sciences. They just take some words they don't like and define them as "DEI", search for those words in the NSF grants applications, and then declare that research definitionally worthless. The "gender" category for example takes "women" as one of those bad words. So in all the evil "gender DEI" research, &gt;70% of the flagged key words just come from mentioning women. In the "environmental justice" category, more than two thirds of the keywords flagged are "climate change", the most obvious research topic of the whole field.</p>
</blockquote><p>But why did the identified percentage rise from 1% to 27% during the Biden administration, as per the linked tweet from Alex?</p>
<p>The methodology may be flawed, but it was applied in the same way to all the years in question. So there is indeed some trend being detected here, although perhaps not the one being claimed.</p>

</blockquote><p>I jest, and obviously if I could wave a wand and fix issues across the world I would, and I certainly feel awful for anyone in Africa or elsewhere dealing with tragic conflict, but the point is that maybe the craziest thing we did over the last few decades was convince everyone they needed to be up to date on all current events and have beliefs on everything.</p>
<p>I know so many amazing people who should be happy and enjoying this brief life we get and instead are daily wrought with anxiety over things that don’t affect them. Of course, they are quite admirably empathetic and serious gems and I love them, but they have both zero ability nor actual willingness to solve some of the situations they let ruin or even just impair their day by learning about.</p>
<p>It’s obviously a nasty game theory problem where if no one cares then it’s a shame, so perhaps some people need to care and I’m complaining for no reason, but I just have a few family members and friends that I’ve seen had days ruined over seeing upsetting news in the morning and I just felt like it was a total shame.</p>

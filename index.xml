<p>&gt; Sponsors of the law say its purpose — prohibiting access to TikTok if it’s not sold to an American entity — is to sever the short-video app’s links to China’s Communist Party. The reality is that the American government will likely end up banning TikTok, turning it off for 170 million American users.</p>
<p>And that should be victory for everyone saying that TikTok and the CCP are one and the same.</p>
<p>Frankly I am sick and tired of all these so-called experts who do not know or refuse to play by tit-for-tat. Every single American company operating in China is a JV or complies with China's data and censorship laws. Can't play by our rules, then GTFO, the CCP says. Well I cannot think of a more reasonable rule than a news platform that broadcasts to half of Americans cannot be owned by the CCP.</p>
</blockquote><p>"Every single American company operating in China is a JV ..."</p>
<p>Sounds like the opposite of truth: "A large majority of new foreign investments in China are WFOEs [=wholly foreign owned enterprises], rather than JVs. As Chinese legal entities, WFOEs experience greater independence than ROs, are allowed exclusive control over carrying out business activities while abiding by Chinese law and are granted intellectual and technological rights." (https://www.export.gov/apex/article2?id=China-Establishing-an-Office)</p>
<p>"WFOE refers to a limited liability company that is 100% invested, owned by foreign investors, and independently operated. Almost 60% of foreign-owned companies are WFOEs, making it the most adopted business type. Famous multinational companies such as Apple, Amazon, Oracle, and General Electric are all examples of WFOEs." (https://arc-group.com/china-company-setup/)</p>

</blockquote><p>I should mention H5N1 bird flu which is infecting dairy cows (don't drink raw milk!) across America and alarming public health officials. One article I read last week described pig farms as a Petri dish for the virus, and that we are in real trouble if the virus spreads to pigs. I don't care for pork myself. Worms, bird flu, I recommend going kosher.</p>

<p>One thing that stands it is that, "post-ban" (whatever kind of ban it is), the range of measurements increases dramatically in every single measured variable.  This strongly suggests a measurement effect on the outcome of the study - e.g., some aspect of measurement method was different in some way prior to the ban and following it.  </p>
<p>Which, in my opnion, suggests that modest changes in any outcomes probably aren't meaningful.</p>

<p>But Haidt is also being a bit silly with this example -  "While in London, I learned about the “cat in a blender” video that circulated widely online last year. Months later, video experts concluded that the video had been digitally edited and the kitten was probably unharmed, but millions of children saw a graphic video of one of the most depraved and disturbing things a human being can do." It would appear that Haidt is old enough to remember the classic SNL Super Bass-o-matic skit. And equally old enough to forget about it.</p>
<p>Yes, some of Haidt's caveats regarding the Super Bass-o-matic skit do apply, but it was one of the most hilarious things a youngish teenage me had ever seen. And yes, depraved indeed.</p>

</blockquote><p>If you really believe that the phones are the sole source of all the mental health issues we think we are seeing then this effect is smaller than expected. School has an outsized influence in the lives of kids that goes beyond the hours they attend. They cant use them to initiate or accelerate conflicts during the time they are in school and dont have the distraction. If you think phones are only part of the problem then I think the results are in line with expectations. A small improvement in grades and a smaller change or no change in mental health. </p>
<p>Even without this study I, and I think most parents, would have supported banning phones at school. There is an obvious cost in distraction if nothing else and close to zero benefit. Even a small improvement would be worthwhile against the near zero benefits of phones at school, I just dont think we should expect to see much of a change in other issues. </p>

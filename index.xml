<p>Egad.</p>
<p>There are other people in the world who question the morals and laws of human existence with ideas, parables, paradoxes, questions, and arguments.  It is likely that most of them are not and never were Jewish.</p>

Some conservatives make the biggest blunders when it comes to education. On one hand they deeply understand and say that most of it is credentialism. And then on the other hand they wonder whether Jordan Peterson’s $500 online course or the University of Austin could work as potential replacements (I’m strawmanning a bit to make a point here)</p>
<p>News flash, it’s the Harvard brand and until you can get anywhere near that level of credentialism, you have nothing. How do you make these alternative education things high status? I have no clue, but perhaps you’d need 100 senior business people to come out and say they’re prioritizing people from X school and treating it as on par with Harvard + direct co-op experiences baked in like Northeastern, but it’s with super top tier firms. Eg Ken Griffin guarantees 10 co-op spots just for kids at this new college, Elon guarantees a bunch of jobs, Marc does too across portcos etc</p>
<p>I disagree with Yarvin on a lot but he did nail this problem that a lot of political activity, on the left and right but usually on the right, is like short-term grift gratification rather than foundational long-term change. He has a riff that if you think the schools are actually that bad and this is all you’re doing about it then you’re either lying or you’re lazy.</p>

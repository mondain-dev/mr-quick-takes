<p>One thing that stands it is that, "post-ban" (whatever kind of ban it is), the range of measurements increases dramatically in every single measured variable.  This strongly suggests a measurement effect on the outcome of the study - e.g., some aspect of measurement method was different in some way prior to the ban and following it.  </p>
<p>Which, in my opnion, suggests that modest changes in any outcomes probably aren't meaningful.</p>

<p>But Haidt is also being a bit silly with this example -  "While in London, I learned about the “cat in a blender” video that circulated widely online last year. Months later, video experts concluded that the video had been digitally edited and the kitten was probably unharmed, but millions of children saw a graphic video of one of the most depraved and disturbing things a human being can do." It would appear that Haidt is old enough to remember the classic SNL Super Bass-o-matic skit. And equally old enough to forget about it.</p>
<p>Yes, some of Haidt's caveats regarding the Super Bass-o-matic skit do apply, but it was one of the most hilarious things a youngish teenage me had ever seen. And yes, depraved indeed.</p>

</blockquote><p>If you really believe that the phones are the sole source of all the mental health issues we think we are seeing then this effect is smaller than expected. School has an outsized influence in the lives of kids that goes beyond the hours they attend. They cant use them to initiate or accelerate conflicts during the time they are in school and dont have the distraction. If you think phones are only part of the problem then I think the results are in line with expectations. A small improvement in grades and a smaller change or no change in mental health. </p>
<p>Even without this study I, and I think most parents, would have supported banning phones at school. There is an obvious cost in distraction if nothing else and close to zero benefit. Even a small improvement would be worthwhile against the near zero benefits of phones at school, I just dont think we should expect to see much of a change in other issues. </p>

<p>Everything I've read of hers has been excellent. The themes stay pretty consistent (Canadian rural life, conflicts between smart free thinkers and less smart people).</p>
</blockquote><p>For those who have not read Munro, I would say start with "The Lives of Girls and Women" or "The Bear Came over the Mountain".  Even "Lives" is not a pure novel, but also a collection of short stories, but they have overlapping characters, so they hang together a bit.  I have recommended them to male friends who want to understand girls and women better.<br />
About half of Alice's 160 or so short stories were published in the New Yorker, and when she won the nobel price, "Bear" was the one they republished to celebrate.<br />
She is truly great.</p>

If you share that view maybe this essay has some value, but I find the idea dubious. Anyone who starts from the assumption "Your culture is wrong and I'm going to teach you how to behave properly" should properly be told to go sit at the kiddy table. (And as an aside, can you imagine the backlash if a man had written such an infantilizing article about teaching his girlfriends to eat properly?) </p>
<p>Further, why do people consider capsaicin to be such an important flavor? I can't imagine a similar article based on cinnamon or clove, much less the cult that spicy food has! What I've found is that such people, far from having superior or refined pallets, typically can't appreciate subtlety or nuance in flavor. When you have one flavor that's so dominant there's no possibility of tasting, much less appreciating, anything else--it's like trying to enjoy a candle-lit meal outside, at noon, in June. </p>
<p>This explains the contempt the author has for German food. I've had a fair amount of it (well, Austrian, but emphatically Germanic), and it's got a lot going for it. It has rich, deep, complex flavors. They allow the food itself to shine, rather than using it as a vehicle for some minor component. This allows the tremendous variance inherent in agricultural products to make each meal a unique experience, each region with its own culinary fingerprint. (This is particularly true of the beer and wine--I know geologists who have studied the effects of local geology on beverage production.) But if all you're interested in is that one single chemical, yeah, you're going to be disappointed. The problem isn't the cuisine, however--anything with a history that stretches back so far that it predates written records obviously has something going for it. The problem is you. ("You" being "the person who has a problem with the cuisine".) </p>
<p>If you're ever in Tehachapi, CA, there's a little German place that's open from about 6 am until they run out of food that I strongly recommend going to. That they ran out of food every time I visited the city is an indication of how good the cuisine is. </p>
<p>If you like spicy food, fair enough. I'm honestly glad you found something to enjoy. But your masochism does not mean that my enjoyment of subtlety and purity of ingredients is somehow wrong. And I find the continuous attempts to belittle those of us who prefer to taste what we're eating to be obnoxious in the extreme.</p>
</blockquote><p>Not germane to German food, but I like the taste of carrots; they don't have to taste of coriander and honey</p>

</blockquote><p>"Here's the deal, if you don't like spicy food your missing out on at least 2/3rds of the world's cuisine."</p>
<p>I've not found that to be the case. I've eaten everything from Norwegian dishes to African to Thai to Aztec (substituting pork for human in that one stew) to Sumerian (I have weird friends), and I've not found that my dislike of capsaicin restricts my enjoyment of those cuisines any more the normal distribution of dislikes would. I've found my shellfish allergy to be a greater restriction on what cuisine I can enjoy than my dislike for capsaicin. (I dislike the term "spicy" because there are a tremendous number of spices other than peppers, and I dabble in ancient cuisine, where "spicy" often meant "containing spices".) </p>
<p>Take Indian food. My wife loves it, so we eat a fair amount of it. (I'm ambivalent about it; it's neither something I seek out, nor something I avoid.) There are a few dishes that I don't like because of the amount of capsaicin, but not nearly 2/3. Maybe 3-4 dishes at a good Indian place (more at a bad one, because idiots think "Indian" means "painful"). Turns out there's a tremendous variety of dishes in one of the most populace nations on the planet, many of which allow the flavors of the actual ingredients to shine through. </p>
<p>And as mkt42 said, if you go to a mid-range or above Indian place they've got options. Capsaicin is a spice, and once you get past the buffets most places will adjust the dish to suit the customer's taste. Some dishes require peppers and the like, sure, just like some require yogurt or shellfish or peanuts, and someone who doesn't like a main ingredient is barred from enjoying those dishes. But given the enormous variety of Indian food, this really isn't much of a restriction. </p>
<p>It's worth noting that you're demonstrating the sort of condescending attitude that I was talking about. "Germans are still in the trenches". They're not. The fact that other people like capsaicin does not mean that those who don't are wrong or inferior. It's a matter of taste, no different from how some people enjoy lavender or cilantro while others do not. And I would argue that if your entire culinary world is limited to one flavor, you're the one who's missing out on the vast majority of the world's cuisine, not me.</p>

</blockquote><p>Sweetgreen salads are vastly better than the iceberg lettuce + tasteless tomato + shredded carrot thing that passes for normal.  Plus, the reverse ‘e’ does something for me.</p>

</blockquote><p>It would be hilarious to contemplate the EU asking America to dismantle its extensive farm subsidy programs, starting with all subsidies and tax breaks connected to corn, as a first step to a free trade agreement. DOA is the correct expression in terms of American politics of taking that step. </p>
<p>It is always interesting to see how many Americans are completely unaware of how extensively American agricultural markets are subsidized and protected, and how there is absolutely no way that any national level politician will commit political suicide by talking about dismantling all the barriers and grants and subsidized insurance and tax breaks in the interest of free trade.</p>

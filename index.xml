<p>I don't think that's necessarily wrong, although the point that gives me pause is whether sprawling gives rise to more pollution.</p>
<p>As per that Neal Stephenson bit from Snow Crash: </p>
<p><i>"All these beefy Caucasians with guns! Get enough of them together, looking for the America they always believed they'd grow up in, and they glom together like overcooked rice, form integral, starchy little units. With their power tools, portable generators, weapons, four-wheel-drive vehicles, and personal computers, they are like beavers hyped up on crystal meth, manic engineers without a blueprint, chewing through the wilderness, building things and abandoning them, altering the flow of mighty rivers and then moving on because the place ain't what it used to be. </p>
<p>The byproduct of the lifestyle is polluted rivers, greenhouse effect, spouse abuse, televangelists, and serial killers. But as long as you have that four-wheel-drive vehicle and can keep driving north, you can sustain it, keep moving just quickly enough to stay one step ahead of your own waste stream. In twenty years, ten million white people will converge on the north pole and park their bagos there. The low-grade waste heat of their thermodynamically intense lifestyle will turn the crystalline icescape pliable and treacherous. It will melt a hole through the polar icecap, and all that metal will sink to the bottom, sucking the biomass down with it."</i></p>

<p>The article focuses on a 15 square block portion of the downtown office district that does sound like it's really struggling: a 44 story office tower sold for a pittance ($4 million) in 2022, an old 21 story office building is vacant with windows boarded up, a parking garage across the street from that building is condemned, 2/3 of storefronts in that area are vacant.</p>
<p>The same article notes that other nearby areas are doing better, with a couple of those thriving: an area just west that's had a lot of residential redevelopment, and an area of restaurants/bars near the Cardinals' baseball stadium.</p>

Then again, I actually sort of like doing chores. 8 years of Catholic school and I still can't sit still, so I may as well do something productive. Plus, if I'm doing chores I can let my mind wander--washing dishes does not require much mental effort--without being interrupted--because anyone who interrupts will get roped into helping. </p>
<p>I do wonder how much bias is in this, though. Where do you fit gardening, or lawn care, into this equation? A good father will teach his kids how to care for a house, and a lot of men use these things for exercise, but they're also chores necessary for the function of many households. Lots of places for the authors to be factually correct but not truthful. </p>
<p>7: I saw this. I wonder how much it replicates. I know the Great Apes engage in systematic warfare, have regional dialects, and a few other traits that used to be considered purely human. It's going to be increasingly difficult to draw a line between "animal" and "human". (I'm fine using a paraphyletic group in this case; it's a useful distinction that we all understand, and whether something's paraphyletic or not has enough of a temporal component that most paleontologists become comfortable with them. Polyphyletic groupings are still not real, which is why fish and trees don't, phylogenetically speaking, exist.)</p>

<p>How absurd it is to deny any experimental drug to a patient with a death sentence for a disease. If pain is a concern, why not have voluntary human trails? </p>
<p>I appreciate Eli Dourado's suggestion for that FDA reform but seems like applying an efficient solution to an artificial problem. Just scrap the FDA process altogether for diseases of this sort.</p>

<p>Disputes about subsidies and incentives:</p>
<p>"<i>In fast-growing South Carolina, lawmakers have pointed to data centers as a major factor in rising electricity demand.</p>
<p>As part of a broader energy bill, the legislature considered a measure that would prevent data centers from receiving discounted power rates.</p>
<p>Republican state Rep. Jay West said inducements such as reduced power rates are appropriate for major, transformational endeavors. He pointed to the BMW factory in Spartanburg, which employs 11,000 people, draws in major suppliers and pumps millions into the state economy.</p>
<p>While data centers boost local property taxes receipts, they don't do much for the state, he said, and shouldn't receive preferential rates. And they are being built faster than new energy generation can be added.</p>
<p>"I do not speak for my caucus or the [legislative] body in saying this," he said, "but I don't think South Carolina can handle more data centers."</p>
<p>The House provision on data center utility rates was quickly struck in a Senate committee, the South Carolina Daily Gazette reported.</p>
<p>Lynn Teague, vice president of the League of Women Voters of South Carolina, said that change was made with no public discussion.</p>
<p>Teague, who lobbies the legislature, said South Carolinians, including more than 700,000 people living in poverty, shouldn't have to pick up the tab for tax or utility breaks for major data center firms.</p>
<p>"We have companies like Google with over $300 billion in revenues a year wanting these folks to <b>subsidize their profit margin at the same time that they're putting intense pressure on not just our energy, but our water</b>," she said.</p>
<p>Lawmakers saw data centers as a possible successor to South Carolina's declining textile industry when they approved the data center incentives in 2012, The State reported at the time. One Republican bill sponsor, then-state Rep. Phyllis Henderson, also cited North Carolina's success with data center incentives, saying South Carolina was "just losing projects right and left to them."</p>
<p>But on the Senate floor earlier this month, Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, a Republican, described data centers as "<b>electricity hogs that aren't really providing a whole lot of jobs</b>.""</i></p>

<p>Anyway, break out the popcorn for the fight between Enviro Loons and the Tech Titans over power generation.</p>

<p>Quite literally, it is universally fraudulent and universally used as a trojan horse for illegal immigration yet not a single Western government has banned this or even reformed this through legislation. Remain in Mexico is a stopgap executive order measure. Has any Western government prosecuted NGOs that enable this for undermining the sovereignty of their own nation? If I smuggle migrants, I can face prison (but rarely do) but if I provide material support and coach migrants while drawing a salary as an NGO activist, it is completely legal and my non-profit or NGO is often funded with taxpayer dollars.</p>
<p>It is getting so shameless to the point where I recently heard from a Indian guy I met in Loudon County, VA that his brother-in-law who is a "student" in Canada is applying for asylum in Canada to avoid deportation. He stated it as a matter-of-fact and didn't feel any shame in telling me this as it is quite common now. In 2022 <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/canada-calling-international-students-asylum-9217912/" rel="nofollow ugc">3,500 Indian students applied for asylum</a>. </p>
<p>Asylum is golden key to bypass every single immigration control. Just scrap all asylum (and refugee) laws altogether. I have no faith any reforms which have been promised by parties for many years and haven't happened yet.</p>
<p>Scap asylum laws. Do not rescue the boats. Do not let migrants across the southern border. Mass deportation and remigration. Any other is just inviting a moral hazard and unacceptable.</p>
<p>P.S. Even legal immigration from MENA is a social and moral disaster. See Sweden bombings. Crime in every nation that has taken in MENA legal migration like Germany is dominated by MENA migrants. Let's not lose sight of this either.</p>

<blockquote><p>He stated it as a matter-of-fact and didn't feel any shame in telling me this as it is quite common now. In 2022 3,500 Indian students applied for asylum [after being misled/scammed by Conestoga College and/or exploitive student "agents" in India].</p>
<p>Asylum is golden key to bypass every single immigration control. <b>Just</b> scrap all asylum (and refugee) laws altogether.</p></blockquote>
<p>Shameless instigators of outrage tend to begin their policy prescriptions with "just..." but ignore the critical factors, like the mismatch highlighted in the linked article:</p>
<blockquote><p>However, that dream has turned into a mirage. For even though Canada is accepting more immigrants than ever before, the system hasn’t been able to keep pace with the numbers of students coming in. As things stand, roughly three out of every 10 international students will likely get permanent residency.</p></blockquote>
<p>Asymmetrical information and negative sum smugglers, scammers, and border coyotes are the key problems. Unfortunately, all value chains are targets of negative sum gamification that ultimately diminishes the true value underpinning these institutions. Truly deserving asylum seekers, skilled foreign workers, and international students with high potential are the ultimate losers. </p>
<p>These are wicked problems requiring thoughtfully designed, implemented, and executed policy solutions, not flippant hand-waving. YMMV.</p>

Many of those onboard were thrown into the Mediterranean Sea and had to swim to another Libyan ship nearby for safety, a rescue group said.</p>
<p>It appeared to be the latest reckless sea interception of migrants by the Libyan coast guard, which is trained and financed by the European Union to stem the influx of migrants to Europe."</p>
<p>Or maybe this from 2021? - "Footage has emerged that appears to show the Libyan coastguard firing on a boat in distress carrying migrant families in the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>Rescue workers from the German organisation Sea-Watch recorded the coastguard patrol vessel apparently trying to ram the small wooden boat and firing shots in an attempt to force the people onboard back to Libya."</p>
<p>As Tyler likes to say, it's already happening.</p>
<p>And don't forget anti-tank rockets. Biker gangs in Scandinavia are well armed. "The Nordic Biker War was a gang war that began in January 1994 and continued until September 1997 in parts of Scandinavia and Finland, involving the Hells Angels and Bandidos outlaw motorcycle clubs. The conflict is also known as the Great Nordic Biker War or Second Biker War (Danish: anden rockerkrig) to distinguish it from the earlier Copenhagen Biker War, which took place between 1983 and 1985.</p>
<p>The conflict arose from disputes over territory and organized crime rackets, as well as personal feuds within the biker subculture. Specifically, the members of both groups sought a monopoly on the right to engage in crime in certain geographical areas. The war resulted in the killings of nine gang members, with shootings and bombings totalling another 74 attempted murders. The bikers utilized car bombs, machine guns, hand grenades, anti-tank missiles and small arms during their gang war, and assassination attempts were even made inside prisons. The majority of the hostilities took place in or around Copenhagen in Denmark, Helsinki in Finland, Oslo in Norway, and Helsingborg in Sweden."</p>
<p>The Somalis are punks in comparison.</p>

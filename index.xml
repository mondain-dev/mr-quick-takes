<p>This is yet another junk observational study.</p>
<p>As the original Israeli booster observational study that showed a 95% reduction of covid death demonstrates so well, you cannot remove the confounder of selection bias.  The booster in that study reduced <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2306683" rel="nofollow ugc"><em>non</em>-covid death</a> by 95% too.</p>
<p>Why are vaccine manufacturers not doing new RCTs to prove all these awesome benefits?  They would make headlines.  They could advertise how well they work.  They could raise their plummeting revenues by convincing all the people who refuse to take more of their product that it saves lives in all kinds of very surprising and -- given that it doesn't actually prevent covid -- barely plausible ways.</p>

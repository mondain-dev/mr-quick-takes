<p>And I'm proud to be an American, where at least I have free speech!<br />
And I won't forget the Brits who spied on their citizens this week<br />
And I'll gladly write down...all our rights on a binding constitution<br />
Cuz there ain't no doubt I love to meme, God bless the U.S.A.!</p>

</blockquote><p>I am surprised at several of the figures.  In fact, I am sure that some of the figures are just plain wrong.  I have been to Egypt and there is no way that  39.9% of the population speak fluent English.  More like 3.9%.  Similarly, many of the other figures seem odd.  I think we can safely ignore this list.</p>

One list of the most cited philosophers."</p>
<p>They looked only at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.  So this is not really a list of "the most cited philosophers" as Tyler claims, instead it's a measure of the interests or prejudices of the editors of that Stanford encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Which could be interesting if one is interested in what those editors think.  But I think the standard more wide-ranging weighted citation indices are more useful and interesting.</p>
<p>This study doesn't have to tackle the tricky problem of weighting, because they can treat all citations as equal within an encyclopedia.  But that's a heavy tradeoff; they're looking at a very narrow universe of citations.</p>

And the promise of resurrection and eternal bliss. Cancer has killed my closest relatives and friends, young and old alike. I'm not sure which is worse: dying by cancer when young and before a long life of suffering or dying by cancer when old after a lifetime of suffering, cancer such a cruel way to end one's long journey through this life. Are the lucky ones those who die young? I recently lost a life-long friend, whose positivity belied a lifetime of suffering, suffering as a child when he nearly burned to death, suffering as a young adult and for the remainder of his life after getting hepatitis from eating shell fish and permanent liver damage, suffering through a long battle with a blood cancer through conventional and unconventional therapy that zapped his strength, and the final insult the brain cancer that killed him. And through it all he was the johnny appleseed who sought out the suffering to spread his good cheer and never-ending positivity. But to Tabarrok it's the FDA's fault, if only the FDA allowed drug makers the freedom to choose, then no more suffering. Sometimes I think that Tabarrok is a pod person, an original A.I. I suffer emotionally from the loss throughout my life of so many close relatives and friends from the scourge of cancer. The FDA didn't cause it and the FDA can't fix it. Suffering are us. The very idea that suffering can be cured is preposterous.</p>
</blockquote><p>Forget the resurrection and eternal bliss. Even experiencing that for trillions of years has to be fatiguing.</p>

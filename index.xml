<p>French and Spanish are popular languages to study for Europeans and Americans so the people visiting these countries may have some language skills. However, few people bother to learn Turkish and probably most people visiting Italy have little ability in Italian.</p>
<p>In general, most big cities in Europe cater to English-speakers well enough and resort towns and islands along the Mediterranean often target specific nationalities. E.g. the Germans go to one Spanish beach town, the English to another.</p>

<p>I dunno if it's that unrreal? Init just a matter of packing circuits tighter and tighter?  Seems like it would even happen faster if people were going for the tightest possible configuration, since there's money to be made on each advance, you have to take the time and trouble to produce each advance, rather than just going directly to the next level.</p>
<p>I dunno much about it but that's my impression...</p>

<p>But US companies aren't!!!  Hilarious, GM was toast in 2009 until Obama bailed it out; Ford had to mortgage it's trademark and Chrysler had to be consumed by Benz.  Meanwhile US automakers benefit from massive trade protection in the form of tarifs on SUVs, which is why almost everything US automakers make today is some kind of SUV, even if it looks just like a sedan!</p>

<p>?? The trucking industry in the US is almost exclusively non union and railroad unions are hardly thriving.  Even Biden put the squeeze on them to agree to terms with the railroads, lest a strike disrupt the rest of Biden's Great Leap Forward.</p>

These companies seem to manage to get a workforce to maintain profitable production.</p>
<p>I think it's perhaps the aversion to local large scale capital investment, particularly in local manufacturing brands.</p>
<p>Capital in Britain seems to prefer to foreign direct investment in overseas industry, or in more agile and service based models in the UK.</p>
<p>The UK is quite open to capital investment and to capital exports, and at the same time, perhaps foreign producers have more muscle to get a good deal from the UK than local capitalists believe that they will get.</p>
<p>It might be that this is actually a wise decision though; car manufacturing is an awfully internationally competitive business, and every industrialising power enters the chat one after the other. If it's not the Italians, its the Japanese, then its the Koreans, then it's the Chinese, then its the Indians.</p>
<p>At some point maybe you do just go "Look, we're going to build Jaguars and Land Rovers and sell them at a high margin as luxury vehicles, at these facilities that require lower levels of investment".</p>
<p>Of course these mass market autos are great symbols of manufacturing prowess, great adverts for the country. But it's also a very competitive market.</p>

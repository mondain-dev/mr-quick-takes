And there’s zero question that insider betting goes on in both parties. I’ve even heard colleagues brag about winning bets *against* their own candidate and party.</p>
<p>It’s also very easy for me to see how fortunes could be won or lost on an election night, when prices fluctuate wildly as results come in, simply by manipulating the flow of information — exit polls, early election results, and especially recount related information. The way we release and announce election results in the US is already painful and stupid.  Why do anything to make it worse?</p>
<p>Having said that, I consumed content on PredictIt and it made me smarter — it was both a measure of *cough* well-informed opinion, and as a sanity check for my own opinions.  And I certainly enjoyed placing the occasional bet (never on a race I worked). No strong feeling here, I just don’t think the issue is as clear cut as Tyler argues given the specter of insider trading.</p>

<p>Is there an economic defense of ticket scalping? I thought that clubs don't like it (and seek to prevent it) because it reduces their share of the profit on ticket sales, and punters don't like it because they'd rather for whatever price x the ticket was supplied at, more of the profit went back into the club. There doesn't seem like any economically useful role scalpers play in speculating on the price that they can resell it for.</p>
</blockquote><p>"Is there an economic defense of ticket scalping? "</p>
<p>Is there an argument against it?  How is it different than trading a stock by buying it at a lower price and selling it at a higher price?</p>
<p>As I've pointed out before, I trade in several markets.  I frequently sell to buyers who don't have time or inclination to sit around waiting for every screaming low price offer.  I spend my time doing that and, in effect, they pay me for my trouble when I offer products to them at a higher price - a price that protects the item from people who would otherwise buy it just because it's cheap.  IOW, I sell to people who want it the most for what it is.</p>
<p>It's perfectly legitimate to function as a middleman to channel products to people who want them the most.</p>

<p>This is where the Democrat party is right now.  They're so invested in their quack beliefs - global warming to CRT to housing policy - that they'll do anything to foist them on the public.  They're simply *completely disinterested* in whether these policies work to the public benefit or otherwise.  In their minds, whatever quack garbage they dream up is immediately a moral imperitive.  </p>
<p>This is why Trump beat Clinton in 2016: lots of people see this.  But Dems are so blinkered to their own quackery that they had to invent Russian interference to explain Trump's victory.  </p>
<p>I'm telling y'all - Scott, Tyler, Alex, Listen up - the cultural revolution is coming, because eventually Dems will have no other way to explain their relentless failure except to blame it on and then wipe out any opposing intellectual movement.</p>

Why the elite colleges did this is debatable, but maintaining the price they charged for the elite education was certainly part of it. After all, colleges are rated in part by the compensation paid recent graduates. Something similar may repeat, as the news spreads that current graduates either can't get jobs or the compensation is far below both expectations and in relation to the cost of the elite education. My point, besides the spectacle of economists at the same elite colleges preaching to us about the sanctity of markets, is that the "war on prices" is attributable to more than ignorance, and includes the ignorance of history by said preachers.</p>

</blockquote><p>To me this is a strong signal Apple management has no clue, but I agree that's the right decision.</p>
<p>The last product that has added material bottom line is the Apple Watch, which was the last product Jony Ive was involved in developing. They've released the AirTags and the Vision since then. Vision has potential and is great hardware but Apple's heart doesn't appear to be in it, and it still suffers the same problems all VR systems have - namely there is still no 'must have' app.  </p>
<p>The car was canceled. </p>
<p>Siri is woefully behind every other AI assistant, and Apple appears lost more generally on AI. </p>
<p>The iphone and ipad are incremental at best and have been for 5+ years. It's really a battery replacement decision and hopefully a few other things have gotten better. </p>
<p>The Apple / Android  ecosystems are largely stable in terms of market share now, and even a hit product isn't likely to change it materially. </p>
<p>So unless they have a really big secret product launch up their sleeves, which seems implausible in this day and age, it's shifted to a mature phase company.</p>

</blockquote><p>For it to be a signal pointed out by a great public intellectual wouldn’t it need a really high correlation? They send out this signal 4 times a year. Their 2022 buys were not an ‘all in’ you should’ve heeded unless you’re a buy’n’hold, in which case, if you like Apple, you have, or will.</p>
<p>https://stockbuybackshistory.com/aapl/?utm_source=popup_no</p>
<p>Tyler is a bright light in an area filled with too much Doesn’t Matter, but, buybacks are semi-controversial. Why should a company be able to deduct nearly $4 billion in interest expense while using 10s of billions to buyback shares? Erase the debt. Or, don’t expense the interest.</p>
<p>Then there are the egregious PE situations in which their takeovers are not profitable, are loaded with debt, then pay out a dividend while interest is deducted.</p>
<p>Buybacks reduce share count before options &amp; ESOPs, raise EPS without raising earnings, do not commit the company to regular dividends and, as the chart shows, do not establish a floor or a ST signal. More often than not for companies buybacks occur at highs, not lows. That’s when companies have cash.</p>
<p>European companies have an annual, quite often variable dividend or a special dividend at year’s end. Annual is unattractive for income investors. A quarterly base plus special or quarterlies + annual special dividend would be preferable.</p>
<p>In Apple’s case, around $5/share, leaving the remainder, $30 billion, to buyback the needed shares for employee programs and reduce share count.</p>

</blockquote><p>You may be right.  I am no insider, with inside knowledge.  But I have heard a different explanation, that Apple "could not find the differentiator."  That is, if we believe that Apple's strategy is to enable a price premium over rival products thanks to a better user experience, it could not find the better user experience in cars.  Basic functionality of cars (stop start steer etc.) is a commodity.  Electric drive shrinks performance gaps dramatically (almost any premium EV is faster 0-60 than even Ferraris of a decade ago).  Autonomy (if it works) REMOVES a dimension of differentiation: if I am just sitting in my comfy seat then the car company cannot impress me with road feel or the thrill of taut steering, etc.  So what am I left with?  Ever-plusher interiors?  Maybe, but Tesla has pushed people away from that ("spartan is better").  Ever better audiovisual, infotainment interfaces?  Competition is beyond intense here and I can't see spending an extra $20,000 (e.g.) for a better version of CarPlay.  Exterior styling?  Maybe, but styling is easily replicated.  Car sharing?  (Enabling my car to be used by others who will pay me a fee to do so?)  Maybe, but part of the iPhone's appeal is to show you have one.  Ever tried to borrow an iPhone from a friend for a few hours?  Anyway, my personal belief is that they couldn't find the differentiator, and every year they waited the competition closed any gap anyway: EV range got longer, ADAS and near-autonomy advanced, interior sound systems added a dozen more speakers, seats became not only heated but ventilated and even massaging, etc.  IMHO anyway.</p>

Cowen is confusing national wealth with individual wealth, odd from the founder of a blog called marginal revolution. Individual wealth actually matters, to their families if not to economists. I had to bring this to Tabarrok's attention years ago, and he commented that he hadn't thought about it that way.</p>
</blockquote><p>Rayward: this is a stupid plan that, like almost every other stupid democrat proposal, does nothing to deal with the actual problem, which is the rising cost of homes, driven by the rising number of idiot Democrat/Progtard bureaucrats creating a rising number of rules and handouts and permits and permissions that reduce the supply and drive up the cost of houses.  </p>
<p>It would be nice if we could say this is done out of mere stupidity, but that's unfortunately not the case.  It's done to create and protect patronage jobs that splash money around to progtards and democrats.  </p>
<p>You might thing we could address the actual problem, but doing that would be efficient, which would create two problems for The Progtardery: 1) the progtards need ever more regulation so the money is under as many different shells as possible and thus it's more difficult to figure out who its going to; 2) an efficient economy with fewer rules would mean the Progtards would have to go out and do something useful, which is a severe hardship on people who believe they should be able to direct everyone to do what they want to do.</p>

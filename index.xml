<p>In various interviews and statements, Fauci has explained that while 6 feet is a guideline, the risk of transmission decreases with increasing distance, and that the recommendation is rooted in scientific observations of how respiratory droplets behave.</p>

Many in the US chose to ignore these and consequently this country had one of the highest fatality rates. As most of the rest of the world figured out, science and public health experts were right, and politicians and talk show hosts led to the unfortunate death of thousands of Americans.</p>

Like engineering, medicine and public health are applied sciences that leverage the tools of science to to make good/fast/cheap tradeoffs in the face of uncertainty. It is foolish to highlight every imperfect tradeoff without discussing the context and timeliness of the decision made. </p>
<p>I listened to Prasad on a <a href="https://www.econtalk.org/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-of-the-covid-vaccine-with-vinay-prasad/" rel="nofollow ugc">recent EconTalk episode</a> and my general impression was that he lacked the critical thinking skills that I'm quite positive Tony Fauci has in spades. Like many journalists, and unlike what I expected from scientifically trained professionals, he clings to a facile and outdated interpretation of the Origins of COVID-19 debate, which has been rehashed in yet another <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/06/03/opinion/covid-lab-leak.html" rel="nofollow ugc">Lab-Leak Opinion Piece</a> by Alina Chan. When did pursuits of truth turn into popularity contests?</p>
<p>Maybe my critical thinking skills are lacking since I continue to think that mischaracterizing the incubation period of COVID-19 was the core mistake made during the pandemic. Most policy mistakes can be traced back to the fact that the disease has an incubation of only 2 days with viral loads peaking around the time of symptom onset. </p>
<p>I used to think the problem was C.P. Snow's Two Cultures, with journalists and other people from the Humanities side of the Two Cultures unable to think critically about STEM issues but the pandemic has cured me of this false conclusion; STEM people are susceptible to fuzzy thinking about technical topics too (see Matt Ridley and Alina Chan). YMMV.</p>

<p>Three models:<br />
I. CWT has some sort of affirmative action thing for women going on. Considering Tyler’s views on implicit bias against female intellectuals, this is perfectly plausible<br />
II. Again, affirmative action but for people Tyler broadly agrees with on political philosophy and shares mood affiliations with. In this case, centrist liberals of a hawkish disposition.<br />
III. Once again, affirmative action but for people who hate Putin, Orban, etc. This is similar to II but not exactly the same. The Tatar guy he hawks (Kamil Galeev, who is going to be on CWT very soon), for example, hates Putin with passion but seems much obviously less committed to the sort of rule-from-Brussels technocracy that excites people in the previous category. Hating Putin does not automatically make you a good liberal.<br />
IV. Tyler Cowen met her and they are on friendly terms for some reason or another.</p>

Nixon out, North Vietnam takes over the south after Democrats cut off aid, gas lines, Jimmy Carter (who is no longer the worst president in US history), inflation hitting 13% until Reagan and Volcker put on the brakes.  Then the 1980s, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, declining interest rates and the genesis of missile defense which modern version has deflected rockets launched by Iran and its proxies (thank you Obama for sending them boatloads of money).</p>

His successor, VP Ford, who became president when Nixon resigned in disgrace (although not for the wage and price controls), took a different approach, imploring fellow Americans to WIN (Whip Inflation Now), which in time became associated with Ford's timidity (he was a mid-westerner) and reputation for ineptitude (Pres Johnson alleged that Ford, when in the House, couldn't fart and chew gum at the same time). WIN was a loser, but Ford did pardon Nixon to end that nation's "long nightmare" (i.e., Nixon's presidency). As for inflation, later (1980s) Paul Volcker, Chair of the Fed, did something indeed, 18% interest rates, that tamed inflation, got Reagan the "strong dollar" Reagan wanted (in part to finance massive deficits), and conferred on Volcker a reputation as a dragon slayer. Not sure about dragon slayer, but what Volcker (together with Reagan) accomplished, besides the contractionary effect of 18% interest rates, was to clear the path for the China Miracle, for which he hasn't been given the credit he richly deserves. Maybe Binder will set the record straight in her new book. As for Ford's challenges with chewing gum, his reputation as inept was attributable to walking and falling, not farting and chewing: he repeatedly fell down stairs, which continues to serve as a metaphor for presidential ineptness at fighting inflation and should be covered in Binder's book. .</p>

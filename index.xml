After graduation jobs were scarce in the late 1970's but I finally landed one doing calculations for an insurance company in Des Moines. A few years later I ran into my high school guidance counselor, who told me I'd scored 160 on the IQ test he administered my junior year, and always wondered why I went to such a mediocre college. That ticked me off at the time because it was his job to guide me, I didn't know and my family certainly didn't,   I was the first one to ever go to college.</p>
<p>Fast forward 50 years, I retired ten years ago as the Chief Actuary of a major consulting firm, am still married to my college sweetheart from that tiny school and have two wonderful kids, one of whom is a senior software engineer for a huge tech company. I may not have been what Alex thinks I could have been, but I wouldn't trade that life for anything.</p>

And even more generally, for sorting by ability.  </p>
<p>Investment in those 5% is generally going to have higher ROI than elsewhere.  But at the very least, you can prevent them from wasting their time in classrooms geared to the average student, or surrendered to the disruptive. </p>
<p>All of which is anathema to today’s “equity” and “social justice” driven education administration.</p>

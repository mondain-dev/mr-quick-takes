<p>But the obvious issue is that there’s real impacts to this, but they’re just too diffuse for anyone to feel sharp pain. Maybe these bees are great and it’s worth stopping for them, but a delay like this hurts retirees and workers with 401ks in META, it increases the chance META has to layoff people associated with it, and I’m sure countless negative other butterfly effects on a society wide level.</p>
<p>I sound a little ridiculous typing this out but I think that’s the point that we don’t take stuff like this seriously enough. Each incident is too small to care about, and fortunately the US is rich enough we can be fine with stuff like this, but it’s insane that we collectively let it fly with no repercussions to the people causing these issues.</p>
<p>Eg the SpaceX delays due to environmental concerns of birds near the launch site IIRC. It’s all fun and games, what’s the real harm in making SpaceX wait 90 days. But then you compound that tons of times over a decade and maybe that drastically hurts US competitiveness 30 years from now in a future space race or conflict and causes millions of deaths.</p>
<p>Of course, worrying about this imaginary stuff seems a bit ridiculous but I think it’s analogous to the whole invisible graveyard FDA debate. Even a few week delay of a pharmaceutical drug doesn’t seem like the end of the world, but across every drug and over decades it’s billions of dollars in OPEX costs that have to then be covered by consumers when they could’ve been going to something more productive, not to mention the suffering and deaths from drugs coming to market later rather than sooner.</p>

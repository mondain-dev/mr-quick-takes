<p>As the paper puts it: "<i>Subtype 3, which followed an unhealthy ‘high protein and low fiber dietary pattern’, had lower well-being scores than other subtypes. ... Individuals, such as in subtype 3, who exhibit a higher intake of fatty meat may experience elevated stress levels and a higher risk of mental disorders, as reported in previous studies on the relationship between diet, stress and mental health</i>"</p>
<p>Fit with my feeling that people with a too much meat (pig meat, cow meat, chicken meat) sort of vibe tend to be people who are reliant on stimulation, low self-control, high levels of impatience, and on average maybe have more self-regulation problems.</p>
<p>"Balanced diet", omnivorous, seems to do best (although maybe the healthy diet subgroup improved after controls for genes or something?).</p>

</blockquote><p>The idea of perpetrating a permanent joke on the public, seems wearisome to me - see the Guild House and Venturi's pleasure in its ugliness, which is suspiciously like trying to impute interest to a buildinf when you haven't the skill to make it pleasing sans your commentary - like going into a business where, if you ask, can you help me? the proprietor answers jocularly and pointlessly "I don't know, can I?" clearly for the 1000th time. (Please tell me this happens to other people though it may be a burden for women to bear.)</p>

YMMV."</p>
<p>But for 99% of people, the only view they'll see of a building is from the outside, not the inside.  Even for the wealthy, they'll only see the outside view for 99% of buildings.  Nor is there anything preventing otherwise traditionally styled buildings from having more expansive windows using modern technology.  Lastly, the idea that traditionally styled buildings are meh inside is questionable.  Here's a local <a href="https://pixels.com/featured/university-of-michigan-law-library-matt-russell.html" rel="nofollow ugc">example</a>.</p>
</blockquote><p>Also is that a great example of:</p>
<p>a) the need for windows to enhance lighting (no longer req)<br />
b) a building with lots of structure that doesn't generate useful space (bcz the need for large high windows)<br />
c) a building that likely has ridiculous modern heating costs<br />
d)  ?? and was kept at a lower temperature for this reason when it was built?? (e.g, heating was more expensive then, and people were used to colder buildings)</p>
<p>e) maybe the most important: a building constructed whent the state didn't already have 3/4 of its revenue committed to social programs that didn't exist then.</p>

You could maintain the same elder care workforce just by moving some workers from other sectors into elder care; if you don’t want immigration, you could try outsourcing jobs that can be outsourced and having your own workforce specialize in ones that can’t be outsourced like elder care.</p>
<p>Additionally, most Asian elders grew up in pretty severe poverty and have relatively low living expectations compared to Americans so won’t require as much care; they don’t have McMansions that need to be maintained by others and don’t need the pensions needed for that.</p>
</blockquote><p>This is boiling frog logic.  You said, "Even if South Korea’s population falls by two-thirds,"  IT ALREADY HAS among the only relevant population, youth.  In 1981, there were 867,410 babies born.  In 2023, about 240,000. Given the TFR now, they'll be under 100,000 in one more generation.  </p>
<p>Your elder care plan better involve 70-year-olds taking care of 90-year-olds.  :) Either way, I'm afraid to inform you that old women can't give birth.  South Korea already pretty much is the Walking Dead.  All those South Korean old men wandering the subways for free all day with no grandchildren, no legacy.  That is South Korea.   And things are getting much, much worse.</p>

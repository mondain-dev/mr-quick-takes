One concern I have about AI and the "intelligence age " is that it will decrease the intelligibility of society. </p>
<p>I think one of the major political and social problems of the modern world is that most people do not really understand how society works. An obvious example is the complexity of doing ones taxes, but the problem extends to all manner of political regulations, technology, medicine (vaccines), etc. We deliberately make increasingly complex rules e.g., from earlier today cars that won't let you speed. These rules are defended as "it's just one more small thing" or "it only affects big corporations who can afford a compliance department", but in reality many of these rules do affect individuals. Most people do not have the ability to reliably navigate these situations. </p>
<p>A good solution would be to make simpler rules that ordinary people could understand leading to a more legible and open society. </p>
<p>AI will instead allow for spiraling complexity. "It doesn't matter how complex the rules are, people just need to ask the AI what they should do". In the end people will become slaves to their AI, doing what the computer says without understanding. It will increase conspiracy theories "the AI is just telling you what the powerful people want". Ultimately, the result will be an increase in division and feelings of helplessness among the majority of people. This will exacerbate unhealthy political movements of various forms of identitarianisms (I think Trump-populism, left-DEI movements arise from similar motivations).</p>

Seems like it’s good when it’s against alcohol (which Tyler does not like - https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/06/do-we-need-antitrust-action-against-big-alcohol.html) but bad when it’s about speeding (which is similarly fatal and bad but Tyler likes?). Also a rare instance of the comments being more measured than the post!</p>

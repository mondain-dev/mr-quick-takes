When I was a lad we were told to get out there and come third for Australia.  But these days kids expect a gold medal for winning a gold medal.  It makes me sick.  What's the matter?  Third place not good enough for you?</p>

But I still prefer a different piece that musters arguments against what people like Oren Cass, and others are actually arguing for. It reminds me very much of the immigration debates where economists on Neoliberal and Econ Twitter come out passionately and point to a few highly talented individuals building companies and point to them say "See! We must be pro-immigration!" as if Oren Casses and the JD Vances of the world and the MAGA voters are opposed to such immigration. </p>
<p>Populist anger at free trade is about the sudden accelerated manufacturing job losses after the inclusion of China in 2001 into the WTO and the ensuing China shock. It was a true shock to the American economy that had many positive and negative effects. The losers are complaining and their complaints in a democratic system deserve hearing and not a generalized tut-tut-ing on how mistaken they are about the benefits of free trade in general. </p>
<p>Oren Cass and other populism-adjacent intellectuals are against the WSJ and the libertarian/free-market consensus of whatever mercantilist or any domestic policy America's trading partner decides to adopt is irrelevant and America must engage in freest possible free trade with them regardless. They are not full-on protectionist ignoramuses just like how the average Trump voter is not against high-skill immigrants. </p>
<p>Even Megan McArdle a libertarian has conceded the giant sucking of American manufacturing driven by China shock was too much for Americans to bear. </p>
<p>I like what <a>Michael Brendan Dougherty wrote</a> two weeks back.</p>
<blockquote><p>The second is whether free-market principles are a national or global agenda. One school has argued, with Paul Krugman, that “the economist’s case for free trade is essentially a unilateral case: A country serves its own interests by pursuing free trade regardless of what other countries may do.” Another school has held out that trade must be thought of not purely in economic terms, but in geopolitical terms. It has argued that a policy we loosely call “free trade” might in fact be conducive to the mercantile and geostrategic aims of rivals like China. It has revived the Hamiltonian wisdom that economic policy is necessary to achieve geopolitical independence and argued that in fact it does matter whether we make microchips or potato chips.</p></blockquote>
<p>So I'd like to read what defenses classical liberal intellectuals have of the post-2001 free trade arrangements America has had with China. I'm already convinced of the benefits of free trade with partners who don't engage in massive IP theft and mercantilism like China.</p>

They are evolving into a party that is anti-growth and anti-development, while the Democrats are evolving in a pro-growth pro-development direction. On paper they still favor lower taxes and regulation , which is pro-growth, but their philosophical stance is backwards-looking. Many of the Republican commenters here are against "YIMBY" - they don't want densification in cities. They want manufacturing jobs back in the places they used to be, and they don't want immigration. This amounts to keeping things the way they were in the 1980s, which is not a pro-growth agenda. Philosophically, they want to prioritize neighborhood stability and job security over economic growth which is why they are against free trade. Meanwhile the Democrats are hot on allowing immigration of new workers and on removing barriers to housing development as well as other infrastructure projects. High speed rail, for instance, might not be efficient, but it's definitely pro-growth leaning in mindset.<br />
It's still a mixed bag at this point, and maybe the R's are still more on the pro-growth side than the D's but it's becoming hard to tell.</p>

<p>“  For all the sneering at rarified concepts such as “neoliberalism,” critics of free trade have no new arguments that economists have not already rebutted.”</p>
<p>I’m not an economists, but a scientist, but it seems to me that there is an argument of limiting free trade in some trump like ways but then deregulating at home. Can someone explain to me why that wouldn’t work from an economists perspective?</p>

Interesting.  It's worth noting that the WSJ also just had an article on Russia's economy and they highlighted the really high inflation.  Regardless, with so many bad predictions on so many aspects of the war in Ukraine, who is making real adjustments based on their mistakes?  It seems like everyone, from every perspective, just wants to double or triple down on bad predictions.  (Of course, this doesn't seem to just impact this war, but on all sorts of predictions in so many fields.)  It feels like the standard response is, "It is true, we thought our ideas would work better, but it just means we need to do our ideas much more vehemently than we originally supposed."  Is there anyone saying, from any perspective, at least with this war, "I was wrong and we really need to re-think this entirely"?  Also, everyone seems to think they know entirely what is in Putin's wicked heart.  Forever wars seem to be really bad.  I think there is more room for negotiation than the warmongers believe, but then, maybe I'm wrong too.</p>

<p>And lots of the discussion has been fruitful! Not necessarily good, but LLMs were totally RLHF’d into not saying politically incorrect things. And tons of regulatory red tape added to the industry especially in the EU.</p>
<p>Of course if you believe in the risk then you believe a lot of these measures have been fruitful so far. Of course it’ll look like insurance where all these discussions / premiums are a waste if nothing happens.</p>
<p>I think the more important question isn’t if we’ll all be paper clipped but what many of us will do with our time if the delta between AI and human labor drops further or goes negative in many jobs.</p>
</blockquote><p>Good comment, better than the one that I was about to make, namely about their line:</p>
<p>"Our central claim is that AI x-risk forecasts are far too unreliable to be useful for policy, and in fact highly misleading."</p>
<p>Well duh, and that's also why so much of the EA stuff went off the rails years ago:  people trying to estimate probabilities that we lack sufficient information about.</p>
<p>But your comment is much better:  we live in a world of high uncertainty, so how do we make decisions about momentous but uncertain events?  We prepare for possibilities not probabilities, knowing that we can't afford to fully prepare for them.  We build to be anti-fragile when feasible.  Etc.</p>

</blockquote><p>A major motivation of the original progressive advocacy was to reduce the lower class population. Eugenics essentially.</p>
<p>Given the demographics of the babies aborted, if Planned Parenthood was being pushed by conservatives today, it would be vehemently denounced by progressives as targeting the poor and minorities.</p>
<p>People real motives often advance under a flag of convenience.</p>
